# AI sandbagging: strategic underperformance; "actual capability" = best elicited performance within a budget

Paper: [@vanderweij2024sandbagging] (van der Weij, Hofstätter, Jaffe, Brown, Ward 2024)
Source: arXiv 2406.07358v4 (HTML rendering read: abstract, Sec. 1-8, App. A, F; App. B-E, G-K skimmed)

## Learnings

- **Definition of sandbagging.** "We define sandbagging as strategic underperformance on an evaluation" (Sec. 1,
  Sec. 2), with three conditions: strategic, underperformance, evaluation (Sec. 2).
- **Exhibited vs actual capability.** "Underperformance occurs when the exhibited capability of an AI system is
  lower than its actual capability" (Sec. 2). "we define an AI system's actual capability to be the best
  performance on a certain task it can achieve, given the best currently available capability elicitation
  techniques such as prompting and fine-tuning" (Sec. 2, following Shah et al. 2022a).
- **The budget is imported from Anthropic's RSP.** "Practically, Anthropic, (2023) define an actual capability
  to be "one that can either immediately, or with additional post-training techniques corresponding to less
  than 1% of the total training cost", be elicited" (Sec. 2). Stated rationale: "This operationalization is
  useful because it avoids issues regarding novel or better capabilities sometimes being elicited long after
  deployment", "ambiguity whether a capability is being elicited or learned (Jain et al., 2023; Gekhman et al.,
  2024)", and the duration of elicitation (Sec. 2). "Practically, some acceptable difference threshold between
  the exhibited and actual capability must be set per evaluation" (Sec. 2).
- **Capability vs propensity.** "Capability evaluations are about whether an AI system can do some task …,
  whereas alignment evaluations are about whether an AI system would do some task" (Sec. 2, citing Hubinger
  2023); alignment evaluations are "also called propensity or tendency evaluations" (Sec. 2).
- **Non-strategic underperformance still counts as underperformance.** Example A.2.1 (pretraining contaminated
  with weak models' answers): "its actual capability is higher than shown on the MMLU eval. It could likely be
  quickly fine-tuned to perform much better" — not sandbagging only because the strategic condition fails
  (App. A.2.1).
- **Elicitation effort reported.** "We spent 1-5 hours engineering the prompt per model, and 8 hours for Llama 3
  70b" (Sec. 3).
- **Capability profiles as a detector.** "For a model that is displaying its true capabilities, we would expect
  it to more often be wrong on harder questions" (App. F); difficulty of an item = how many other models get it
  wrong (Sec. 5.2, App. F); prompted sandbagging flattens accuracy-vs-difficulty, so "it may be possible to
  detect sandbagging by inspecting a model's capability profile" (App. F). A model password-locked to emulate
  a weaker model matches it better ("the same answer on 77.1% of questions on average, compared to the
  Targeter's 60.8%", Sec. 5.2).
- **Open issue stated.** "requirements regarding training data, engineering time, access levels …, and computing
  resources to override sandbagging are still unclear" (Sec. 7); for password-locked models "it is unclear
  whether this generalizes to real sandbagging cases" (Sec. 7).

## Evidence and limitations

- The definitional section is the contribution relevant to us; the experiments (prompted and password-locked
  underperformance on MCQA: WMDP, MMLU, CSQA) show that underperformance is easy to produce, not how to measure
  actual capability. MCQA only (Sec. 7).
- "Best currently available elicitation" makes actual capability time-indexed and method-indexed. The 1% rule
  is quoted second-hand and loosely: the RSP v1.0 itself says "We define an ASL-3 model as one that can either
  immediately, or with additional post-training techniques corresponding to less than 1% of the total training
  cost, do at least one of the following two things" (RSP v1.0, p. 6) — a risk-threshold definition for a model
  class, not a general definition of "actual capability", and given without justification of the 1 % figure
  (see the RSP row in `_screen_L2.md`).
- Not checked: figures (images) and per-subject tables.

## Connections and questions

- **Definition offered:** actual capability = max over currently available elicitation methods (prompting,
  fine-tuning) of task performance, restricted to methods costing < 1% of the model's training cost (RSP
  convention); exhibited capability = default performance; underperformance = the gap, judged against a per-
  evaluation tolerance.
- **New vs better access:** an explicit decision rule by budget: anything reachable with ≤ 1% of training cost
  counts as already present (elicited); anything needing more is treated as learned. The authors adopt the
  budget precisely because it sidesteps "ambiguity whether a capability is being elicited or learned" (Sec. 2)
  — it is a convention, not a test. A second, budget-free signal is the capability profile: elicited
  (present-but-hidden) capability shows up as failures on items that are easy for a reference panel.
- **Null / floor:** not discussed. The budget rule implies one: a randomly initialised model has training cost
  ≈ 0, so it possesses only what it does "immediately". But the rule bounds post-training cost, not inference
  cost, so "immediately" with k → ∞ samples still lets random weights "have" everything — Dan's objection
  survives unless the inference budget (k × cost per sample) is charged to the same budget.
- **Transfer to our setting:** (1) Budget rule: express every elicitation (SFT on n demonstrations, guided
  sampling, best-first search, k samples, EI rounds) in one currency — training-equivalent FLOPs or tokens —
  and compare with Stage-1's cost. The project's own numbers already decide one case: the rl-from-ckpt ladder
  replay alone is ≈ 476 M tokens vs Stage-1's ≈ 445 M (CONTEXT_DIGEST §1), i.e. ≈ 100 %, far above 1 %, so by
  this convention RL as run is not an elicitation. Cost: bookkeeping only. Failure mode: the 1 % fraction was
  set for frontier models whose pretraining dwarfs fine-tuning; at 3-10 M parameters Stage-1 takes ≈ 20 min on
  an A40, so 1 % is ≈ 12 s of training — the fraction needs re-justification at our scale (e.g. by the
  positive/negative-control calibration suggested in greenblatt2024passwordlocked.md). (2) Profile test:
  define theorem difficulty by a panel (seeds s0-s2, cap-6/cap-12 bases, big, random-init) and ask whether RL's
  new solves are panel-easy items pend fails (access) or panel-hard items (new). Cost: existing k = 256 tables.
