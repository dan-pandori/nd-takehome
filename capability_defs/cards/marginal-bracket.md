# Card: the bracketed base solve probability

Families S + L (the bridge between sampling and likelihood). Slug `marginal-bracket`. Notation: `_FRAME.md`.

## 1. Definition, formally

The quantity is the base model's single-attempt solve probability p_B(t) = Σ_y π_B(y | t) V(t, y), bracketed from both
sides. No new modelling assumption is needed; each side is valid on its own.

- **Known-proof estimate (likelihood; a lower bound in exact arithmetic).** LB(t) = Σ_{y ∈ F(t)} π_B(y | t).
  - F(t) is the set of distinct Lean-accepted proofs of t found by any model in any read: every pretraining checkpoint,
    every RL round, every seed, both caps, references, and the base's own large-k samples.
  - Each π_B(y | t) is teacher-forced at the sampler's temperature (T 0.8), with the 33 name bases marginalised.
  - In exact arithmetic LB ≤ p_B: p_B is a sum of non-negative terms over all valid proofs, and F(t) is a subset of
    them. In practice it is an estimate (measured caveat below).
  - With one name base scored, each term may be replaced by its own lower bound π_B(y | b = 0) / 33 (J1 stage 1).
- **Upper bound (sampling).** UB(t) is the one-sided 95 % Clopper–Pearson bound from every independent base attempt
  on t: draws x0, x1, x2 (and x4 for group C) at k 256 each, plus J2's 16,384 or 65,536.
- **Point estimate where the base succeeds often enough:** p̂ = c / n.
- **Importance-sampling estimate (optional).** For a large enough sample from R,
  p̂_IS(t) = (1/n) Σ_{i : y_i ∼ π_R} V(t, y_i) π_B(y_i) / π_R(y_i). It is unbiased when π_R covers the base's solution
  set, which holds for softmax policies.
- **RL's coverage by F:** Σ_{y ∈ F(t)} π_R(y | t) / p̂_R(t), the share of RL's success mass that the known proofs
  carry. This checks how complete F is.

**Measured caveat (Part 3).** The sum is *not strictly* a lower bound in practice.
- Over every theorem where pend's p is measured (64 / 59 / 71 per seed), LB / p̂ has 10th–90th percentiles of
  0.28–1.34 / 0.38–1.15 / 0.16–1.28 (medians 0.95 / 0.91 / 0.92), and it exceeds the sampling 95 % upper bound on 3 /
  2 / 1 of them.
- The likely cause is name conditioning. The scorer conditions on canonical names, while the sampler conditions on its
  own sampled names, which the environment then renames: ≈ 14 % of names defined in J2.
- So it is a well-calibrated *estimate*, and certificates use a factor-2 margin (LB ≥ 2 / K).

## 2. Decision rule

*Revised after the critic pass (§9).* **The primary output is budget-free:** each theorem's k-to-solve interval for the
base, [1 / UB(t), 1 / LB(t)] attempts. Verdicts follow only for a declared budget.

At a budget K from `_FRAME.md` (headline K_eval-set; K_per and K_total beside it), for each theorem that R solves at
k 256:

| verdict | rule |
|---|---|
| **elicited at K** | LB(t) ≥ 2 / K (factor-2 margin: LB is an estimate), or the sampling lower bound ≥ 1 / K |
| **created at K** | UB(t) < 0.05 / K (≈ 60 K zero-success base attempts) |
| **not reached at K** (cheap) | 0 base successes in ≥ K attempts, not elicited |
| **undetermined** | otherwise |

The bracket's width, log UB − log LB, is reported for every theorem. It says how far the evidence is from a verdict.

## 3. Null or floor

- The same bracket for random initialisation: LB_init is computed in J1 (init is scored), and UB_init = 3 / n from init
  reads (0 solves).
- LB_init is about e^(−10³). The bracket puts random weights below any compute-tied budget by hundreds of orders of
  magnitude, so the random-weights objection is answered numerically.

## 4. How to compute it here

- **Inputs.** Existing reads, J1 (every known proof under init / pend / r8 / r16, ≈ 1.3 × 10⁵ proofs per seed) and J2
  (pend's large-k samples).
- **Cost.**
  - J1 stage 1 ≈ 0.4 A40-hours for all seeds.
  - J1 stage 2 (exact 33-base rescoring of the top proofs per theorem, plus every proof pend itself found in J2):
    ≈ 4,000 proofs per seed, about 20 min per seed.
  - J2 ≈ 1 A40-hour per seed (stage A).
  - Analysis: `cd_bracket.py`, CPU-seconds.
- **Final numbers** (stage 2 exact terms for the top proofs, stage-1 bounds elsewhere; J2 stages A / A′ / B;
  `out/bracket_all.txt`, `out/bracket.json`; s0 / s1 / s2):
  - Calibration (30 theorems per seed, p measured from ≈ 4,900 attempts): exp(LB) / p̂ median **0.98 / 0.94 / 0.93**
    (10th–90th percentile 0.75–1.11). The best single proof carries a median 0.62 / 0.50 / 0.51 of LB.
  - Of the hard theorems r8 solves (55 / 45 / 52), certified elicited at K_total by LB: 42 / 32 / 44; at K_per by
    LB: 2 / 0 / 4 (by the sampling lower bound 3 / 0 / 5); certified created at K_per (0 in ≥ 65,536): 21 / 19 / 11.
  - At K_eval-set: elicited 22 / 18 / 24, found but not certifiably within reach 12 / 9 / 18, not reached (0 in ≥ K)
    21 / 18 / 10, undetermined 0; certified created 3 / 2 / 2 after J9's ≈ 1.2–1.5 M extra attempts on nine theorems
    (REPORT §3.1, §3.8).
  - The k-to-solve intervals put the median RL-solved hard theorem at 10^4.6 / 10^5.3 / 10^4.5 attempts (F1).
  - The set this card contributes to the agreement matrix ("not certified elicited at K_eval-set", i.e. created ∪
    undetermined ∪ not certifiably within reach): 29 / 26 / 25 (r8, x0).

## 5. Sensitivity

- **Temperature.** Use T 0.8 (the sampler's) for the bound that is compared with sampling budgets. At T 1.0 the bound
  describes the model's distribution, not the sampler's.
- **Decoding.** A guided decoder has a different p. Bracket it separately, or not at all: its probability of a proof
  is not a product of plain π terms.
- **Completeness of F.** LB grows as F grows; adding the base's own J2 successes matters most. F is drawn from every
  model; whichever model found a proof, it is scored under the base (name conditioning aside, a valid term).
- **Representation.** The bracket is per interface (proof-state here). Whole-proof models need their own scores.
- **Renaming / premise order.** Bracket each prompt. A renaming class gets the minimum (for creation) or the maximum
  (for elicitation) over its members.
- **Noise.** LB has no sampling noise. UB has exact binomial noise. Across seeds, p_B differs by large factors
  (`support-state`: median p̂ 20× apart between two base seeds).

## 6. Failure modes

- **Name conditioning.** The scorer conditions on canonical names, not on the model's own sampled name tokens, so π_B
  is not exactly the sampler's probability (unquantified; `trajectory`). A bias here could move LB either way.
- **Creation is rarely certifiable** (≈ 60 K samples needed); most hard theorems at K_per may end "undetermined".
- **Truncation.** Read caps cut some attempts; UB is then an upper bound for the capped sampler, not the uncapped one.
- **Validity of F's members.** Every term must be a Lean-accepted proof. F is built only from proofs accepted by Lean
  on the literal sampled text. The canonical rendering is re-derived by `decompose` and must replay exactly, or the
  term is dropped (24 of 136,466 for s0).

## 7. Relations

- Makes `tf-proof-prob` (theorem level) and `passk-budget` decidable.
- LB ≥ max_y π_B(y) ≥ π_B(y_ref).
- Its elicited side implies "elicited" for `passk-budget`; its created side is the same rule.
- Its components feed `sharpen-expand` and `new-proof-new-theorem`.

## 8. Literature anchor

- **Wu & Hilton 2024 (2410.13211v2).** Importance sampling gives "an unbiased estimator for the true probability"
  (Sec. 3.1). "As long as the required importance sampling ratios can be computed, any method for red-teaming can be
  turned into an importance sampling method" (Sec. 6.2).
- **Zhao et al. 2024 (2404.17546).** Sequential Monte Carlo bounds on the probability of satisfying a constraint
  (screened by L3).
- **Brown et al. 2024 and Kazdan et al. 2025.** Why sampling alone cannot resolve small p (`passk-budget`).
- **Chen & Foster et al.'s coverage principle** (earlier review). Coverage is sequence-level mass on correct outputs.
- **Our construction.** Summing the base's probability over every known proof is our own. The literature we found
  uses importance sampling or SMC estimates, not this sum.

## 9. Critic's verdict

**Strongest argument (critic): the verdict depends on which K is quoted.**
- K_per and K_total are both "RL's compute" but are 4,495× apart, and their verdicts do not overlap.
  - At K_total, creation can never be certified (2.1 × 10⁸ attempts per theorem), while the lower bound with
    trajectory's exact scores of the reference and eventual proofs already certifies 38 of s0's 55 RL-solved hard
    theorems as elicited.
  - At K_per, the lower bound reaches 1 / 777 for only 2 of 55, and J2 stage B can add "created".
- K_total also gives pend, per theorem, about 17× its own pretraining compute: ≈ 1,650× the 1 %-of-training-cost
  elicitation convention.
- Secondary arguments:
  - A cheap method (rescaling the logits) has its own small K and can be "created" (gaming).
  - 20 of the 55 lie within ±ln 20 of −ln K_total, so seed noise decides them.
  - `la_transfer_595`'s reference scores e^(−14.0) marginalised over the 33 name bases but e^(−22.0) at base 0: exact
    minus base-0 ranges from −3.4 to +10.9 nats, so verdicts depend on hypothesis numbering unless scores are
    marginalised.

**My answer: accepted in substance.**
- The card's primary output is now the k-to-solve interval [1 / UB, 1 / LB], which needs no budget.
- Verdicts are given only for budgets declared before the data. The report's recommended budget menu (REPORT
  § recommendation) is:
  - K_eval-set (compute-matched over the evaluation set, ≈ 1.9 × 10⁴, from the `passk-budget` critic);
  - the base-tied "1 % of pend's training compute" (≈ 2–4 × 10³ attempts per theorem, this critic's proposal).
- K_total is dropped as a creation budget and kept only as an upper reference for "elicited".
- Decisive terms are rescored at 33 name bases (stage 2) before any verdict.
