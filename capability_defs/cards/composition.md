# Card: composition of skills that each exist in the base — DROPPED as a decision rule; kept as a descriptive column (critic, §9)

Families T / N. Slug `composition`. Notation: `_FRAME.md`.

## 1. Definition, formally

A proof is a sequence of moves; a move is a (state → action) decision.

- **Step-level support of the base:** move a_j at state s_j is "known" if π_B(a_j | s_j) ≥ ε_step. ε_step is the
  per-step budget: with guided redraws up to 10 rejections per step, ε_step ≈ 1/10–1/30; for plain sampling the step
  must also fit in the whole-proof budget.
- **A composite capability on t is "a new composition"** if, for RL's proof y_R (detours removed):
  - every move is in the base's step-level support (w1 under π_B ≥ log ε_step);
  - yet the whole proof is outside the base's reach (log π_B(y_R) < −ln K, and the theorem-level bracket agrees).
- **"A new move"** if some move of y_R is outside step-level support at its state.
- **Multiplicative null** (Okawa et al.): if components succeed independently with probabilities p_j, the composite
  succeeds with ≈ Π_j p_j. A composite whose base probability is far below the product of its components' base
  probabilities (in the contexts where they occur) has an interaction cost.

## 2. Decision rule

| verdict | rule |
|---|---|
| **created by composition** | all moves known (w1 ≥ log ε_step) and the theorem out of reach at K. RL created the capability by composing old skills, the most common kind of "creation" this definition expects |
| **created by a new move** | some move outside step support (w1 < log ε_step) and the theorem out of reach |
| **elicited** | the theorem within reach at K |
| **neither** | R fails |

## 3. Null or floor

- The multiplicative model is the null for "emergence" of composites: sudden jumps in composite success are expected
  when every component improves smoothly.
- Random weights fail every step (per-step log p ≈ −200 nats at init).

## 4. How to compute it here

- **Step log p** of RL's proofs under pend: J1 (per-step at one base, stage 1; exact for the top proofs). Trajectory's
  scores give the eventual proofs' worst steps at pend.
- **Existing numbers** (`trajectory`, B group at cap 12, IQM): worst step at pend −6.2 nats (≈ 1 in 500), with
  everything else in the proof ≈ 7–9 nats. **By this card, most of B is "new composition of known moves", or elicited**:
  no single step is beyond a guided budget of 1 / 500, but the product is ≈ e^(−15).
- At cap 6 the worst step at pend was ≈ 1 in 22,000–25,000 (`trajectory-cap6`; `claim-audit` C5b), so more "new move"
  cases there.
- **Excluded middle:** is the DN step (`Classical.byContradiction` on a ¬¬-goal) in pend's step support at those states?
  This is answered by J1 for the holdout250 members.

## 5. Sensitivity

- **ε_step:** the decoder decides it (plain vs guided).
- **Route:** another proof of t may have no out-of-support step.
- **Representation:** in the proof-state interface the environment writes some tokens (box closings), so the moves
  differ from whole-proof moves.
- **Temperature:** T 0.8.
- **Name conditioning** (scorer vs sampler; `tf-proof-prob`).

## 6. Failure modes

- **"Known move" is state-relative:** a move known in some states may be unknown in the RL proof's states. The test is
  per state, as defined.
- **Compositions can be trivial** (padding).
- **The multiplicative null assumes independence,** which proofs violate (later steps depend on earlier choices).

## 7. Relations

- Splits the created cell of `passk-budget` / `marginal-bracket` into two kinds.
- `tf-proof-prob`'s step level gives the moves.
- `schema-acquisition` says which compositions recur.
- `chain-reachability` explains how compositions are found: one step of reach at a time.

## 8. Literature anchor

- **Okawa et al. 2023 (2310.09336):** "Compositional Abilities Emerge Multiplicatively", P(n) = (1 − (1 − p)^t)^n
  (Sec. 4; L5 note).

- **Mousavi-Hosseini & Erdogdu 2026 (2603.06957):** process-reward RL is limited by the base's worst-token quantile,
  which is our w1 (Sec. 4).
- **Earlier review:** Yuan et al. 2025 "From f(x) and g(x) to f(g(x))" (RL composes old skills).
- **Project:** `lit-measures` (one bad step), `trajectory` (worst step), `organism-analysis` (hard steps).

## 9. Critic's verdict

**Strongest argument (critic): the "new move" test measures where a step is placed, not whether the base has the move.**
- All 13 rules occur in ≥ 4 % of K12 records, so a "new move" can only be state-relative. A known move in a new
  position is, by the card's own definition, composition.
- Counterexample: `la_transfer_1015` (s0). pend 0 / 768 at k_eval and 9 / 17,152 in J2; the replay-only control 0 / 512.
  RL's proof is the 8-step reference. Its one bad step is `have n6 : ¬((Q→P)→P) := n1.2` (∧E) at −17.4 nats under pend,
  so the card says "new move". Yet all three proofs pend found contain this exact ∧E step, placed elsewhere.
- Of s0's 24 J2 "not reached" theorems, 21 get "new move" at ε = 1 / K_per, every one on an ordinary rule.
- Secondary arguments:
  - It judges RL's route, not the theorem (46 of 90 verdicts flip with the best known route).
  - ε_step is unjustified (the "new move" share moves 7 %–48 % with the settings).
  - It has no creation criterion of its own.

**My answer: accepted; dropped as a decision rule.** By rule type, "new move" is empty by construction here (every rule
is in the pretraining data). Per state, it measures placement, which is composition. The best known route's worst
step (max over F(t)) is kept as a descriptive "bottleneck" column on the `marginal-bracket` created set. Every
creation candidate in this run is therefore a new composition of old moves; the card's one firm statement survives as
a description, not a test.
