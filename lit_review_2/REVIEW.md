# Literature review 2: create vs elicit since 2025, exploration outside support, model organisms (run `lit-review-2`, 2026-10-02)

This review extends `lit-review` (2026-09-29, 58 papers), which is not re-screened here. **51 new papers were screened**
(48 at abstract level or deeper, plus 3 abstract-only id checks) and **11 were read in depth** (`notes/`). The count is
above the brief's 25–40: three parallel screening agents each took 12–17, and I added four to cover two threads the
brief names. Every quote was fetched into `~/lr_sources/` and grepped. The three agents' ledgers (110 claims; 8 marked wholly or partly
UNVERIFIED) and my independent re-check (33 / 33 verbatim) are in `claims.md`. No model was run, so no number here is
new. Where our runs are cited: `trajectory` and `rl-from-ckpt` used best-cap12, a 9.56 M `lean_staten` model trained from
scratch on K12 (cap 12), 3 seeds, Lean alone. `trajectory-cap6` is the cap-6 sibling.

## Bottom line

1. **The standard is still Yue et al.'s equal-k pass@k** (2504.13837v5). It is a finite-budget support test. Its own
   likelihood evidence covers two problems (Fig. 6 caption). Our A/B/C split is weaker still: the base is read at k 256,
   while RL draws from a moving policy.
2. **The convincing creation designs control pretraining and intervene on it.** The closest analogue to us is
   Abdulsalam, Patel & Saxe (2607.07646v1). It pretrains from scratch on a rewrite grammar that excludes the shortcuts.
   "even at pass@1024, the pretrained policy gets 0% on Buckets 4–5, while RL later solves them at pass@16", and "RFT
   then plateaus". It reports no likelihoods, which are exactly what we can add.
3. **Exploration that reaches outside support always has a source other than the policy's own samples:** random
   actions after returning to an archived state (Go-Explore), enumerated actions with root noise (AlphaZero), heuristic
   injection (DeepHOL-Zero), oracle prefixes (POPE), or a frontier LLM (AlphaEvolve). On-policy bonuses do not move
   zero-reward problems (2601.18779v1).
4. **For group C and proposal 20,** the best-supported additions are:
   - start episodes from reference-proof prefixes (POPE, and Go-Explore's backward algorithm);
   - keep ε on for the whole run (DeepHOL-Zero: 7.0 % without exploration, 56.3 % with, 1905.10501v3 Fig. 4).

## Q1. Create vs elicit, 2025–2026

**Evidence.**
- **Yue** finds that the base surpasses RLVR "as k increases". Base-unsolved, RL-solved problems are 0.0 % (AIME24,
  k 1,024) and 1.0 % (MATH500, k 128) (Table 2).
- **ProRL** (2505.24864v1) claims gains "where base models fail entirely". Those gains are largest where the base is
  weakest, on Reasoning Gym tasks where "the base model struggles with formatting" (§4).
- **Successors** make the boundary depend on training length and width:
  - early shrinkage, later expansion (2510.04028v1);
  - BroRL "revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps" by widening rollouts (2510.01180v1).
- **"Mirage or Method?"** (2508.21188v2) finds that one-shot RL, noisy rewards and negative-only training work "only
  when the model and task already exhibit strong model-task alignment", measured by pass@k. That bears on the
  negative-gradient thread (Zhu 2506.01347; sample polarity 2512.21625v1, where "negative samples encourage exploration
  of new reasoning paths").
- **Power sampling's successors** make the sharpening null cheaper. A token-level approximation "matches or surpasses
  one-shot GRPO" at more than 10× less latency than MCMC (2601.21590v1). The power distribution is "the closed-form
  optimizer of KL-regularized RL when the model's sequence-level log-probabilities are used as the reward" (2605.04542v1).
- **Theory.** Sharpening cannot "create information that is not already in the model" (2412.01951v2). Coverage is
  "necessary and sufficient for Best-of-N" (2510.15020v2), and coverage "lower bounds the runtime" of RL
  (2503.07453v2). Coverage is **sequence-level**: mass on correct outputs ≥ ≈ 1/k.
- **Excess description length** (2601.04728v1) predicts a shape test: EDL per token falls with data for elicitation
  and rises first for teaching. Its empirics are in a companion paper I could not find (UNVERIFIED), and it is "SFT
  only": "Extensions to reinforcement learning … require additional development".

**Designs, ranked by how well they separate creation from elicitation:**
1. Controlled pretraining plus an intervention that adds or removes the skill. Examples: 2607.07646v1 (ρ sweep),
   Tsilivis 2510.11495v2 (p_cot dial), Interplay 2512.07783, behaviour priming 2503.01307v2.
2. Clean generators with reward controls (true, random and wrong reward; 2507.10532v3, 2506.10947v2).
3. A pre-registered sequence-level coverage threshold, plus a matched power-sampling null.
4. Equal-k pass@k plus base perplexity (Yue).

**Where our designs fall short:**

| shortfall | literature | cheapest fix |
|---|---|---|
| Base read at k 256; "B" is RL-solved within an unequal budget | Yue Table 2; 2510.08325v2 | re-read end-of-pretraining on B ∪ C at k ≥ 4,096; plot equal-k curves |
| `rl-from-ckpt`'s creation threshold was calibrated post hoc | 2510.15020v2 | pre-register "covered at k" as sequence log p ≥ −ln k (−5.5 nats at k 256) |
| Worst-step w1 is a token-level unit, but the ladder samples whole proofs | 2503.07453v2 (token-level coverage suffices only with multi-turn exploration) | report sequence log p beside w1; w1 is right for the state env's step sampler |
| One reference proof's log p is only a lower bound on the mass on correct proofs | 2510.15020v2 | large-k solve rate on C, not the reference's −12 nats, decides "outside support" |
| No causal intervention on coverage | 2607.07646v1, 2510.11495v2 | remove one rule pattern from pretraining and test whether RL creates it |
| Short, narrow RL (8 × 32) | BroRL; 2510.04028v1 | one wide arm on C (k 256 per round) before calling C "unreachable" |
| No sharpening null | 2601.21590v1 | scalable power sampling of the end checkpoint at matched tokens |

Lean makes our pass@k equal to CoT-pass@k (2506.14245v2), so the lucky-guess critiques do not apply to us.

## Q2. Exploration outside support

| method | out-of-support evidence | strength | pretrained prior? |
|---|---|---|---|
| AlphaZero / MuZero (root Dirichlet noise, self-play) | superhuman from "random play"; concepts "not present in human games" taught to 4 grandmasters (2310.16410v1 Table 4) | strong for the system; noise never ablated (1712.01815v1) | no |
| AlphaProof PUCT + progressive sampling | policy samples only; variant curriculum (proposal 20) | IMO results, no support measure | yes |
| RMaxTS | +1.2 points at equal samples (earlier note) | weak | yes |
| Go-Explore | Montezuma "completely" solved; return-then-explore against derailment (2004.12919v6) | strong (state coverage) | no |
| Count / RND / Agent57 / ICM | 15 Montezuma rooms (1606.01868v2); scores | moderate | no |
| DeepHOL-Zero heuristic injection | 7.0 % → 56.3 % from random init; one-off seeding not enough | strong for theorem proving | no |
| Entropy, pass@k and clip-higher objectives | "do not resolve" zero-reward problems (2601.18779v1) | negative | yes |
| Representation bonus (RepExp) | large-k pass@k kept; samples "less likely under the base"; weak models "no benefit or even degradation" (2510.11686v2) | moderate-weak | yes |
| CDE curiosity | ≈ +3 AIME points (2509.09675v1) | weak | yes |
| Self-play variants (SvS) | pass@k to 1,024 above the initial model; augments only problems at 12.5–50 % accuracy (2508.14029v4) | moderate | yes |
| Oracle prefixes (POPE) | unguided solving of hard problems; transfer back | moderate (abstract-level read) | yes |
| LLM evolution (AlphaEvolve) | beats SOTA on ~20 % of > 50 problems | strong, but search, not a policy | frontier LLM |

**Qualifications to proposal 20:**
- **E2.** No source applies ε-random actions to a sequence policy (UNVERIFIED, from absence after search). Go-Explore
  argues that random actions mixed in "throughout an episode" derail, so apply ε **after returning** to a stored partial
  proof; the state env makes return free. DeepHOL's goal-similar injection supports E2's subformula bias.
- **E3.** DeepHOL-Zero is the precedent and predicts our step-0 null: "With no new training data, the learning process
  would stall." Keep ε on throughout, and add a seeded-only control.
- **E1.** AlphaZero's noise works over an enumerated move set. With sampled tactics it can only reweight what was
  sampled (our reading), so E1 + E2 root noise over valid actions is the true analogue.
- **Correction to the Q2 agent's synthesis.** "Group C's single −12-nat step" is not supported. The `trajectory` review
  rejected "C stays at one bad step", and proposal 20 describes "several far-off steps".

## Q3. Model organisms

| domain | exact coverage control | RL phase published | what it could show |
|---|---|---|---|
| rewrite grammar (2607.07646v1) | yes (ρ) | yes, GRPO vs RFT | new action types; RFT ceiling |
| parity, short/long CoT (2510.11495v2) | yes (p_cot) | yes | amplification closed form p_n = 2p_{n−1}/(1+p_{n−1}); **p_cot = 0 untested** |
| graph path-finding (2509.22613v2, 2601.15158v4) | yes | yes, theory | PG without KL = SFT on own successes (our ladder); collapse to "one path per pair" |
| Physics of LMs (2305.13673v4, 2407.20311v1) | yes | not in Parts 1 / 2.1 | RL to unseen operation depth |
| Othello-GPT (2210.13382v5) | yes | no | does RL change the probed world model? |
| grokking (2301.05217v3; 2602.14872v3) | yes | theory predicts RL plateaus | circuit formation under a verifier |
| chess, Transcendence (2406.11741v4) | rating cap | no; gains from low temperature | RL past the denoising ceiling ("ChessFormer 1500 is unable to transcend") |
| program synthesis (DreamCoder) | partial | wake-sleep | library growth |
| FOL / ND (Minimo; DeepHOL; ours) | yes | yes | per-step log p of any proof at every checkpoint (ours only) |

Ours is the only organism with likelihoods of arbitrary proofs along the whole trajectory. Parity and graphs are
minutes-cheap calibration controls. The rewrite grammar is the one to contrast with directly.

## Implications for our project (ranked by value)

1. **Equal-budget support re-read plus a pre-registered coverage threshold.** Re-read B ∪ C at the end of pretraining
   (best-cap12) at k ≥ 4,096, with "covered" = sequence log p ≥ −ln k, alongside a scalable power-sampling null.
   This settles "elicitation" for `trajectory` and `rl-from-ckpt` to the field's standard. It is cheap: reads only.
2. **Reference-prefix starts for group C** (POPE / backward algorithm): start at the state before the far-off steps,
   move the start back over rounds, and evaluate unguided. It is the only literature-backed route for zero-reward
   targets, and proposal 20 lacks it.
3. **Proposal 20 E2 / E3 revisions:** ε after return, ε on throughout, a seeded-only control (DeepHOL-Zero, Go-Explore).
4. **A coverage-removal intervention:** delete one rule pattern from pretraining, at p = 0 and at small p (the
   Tsilivis dial), then RL. Creation at p = 0 would be new to the literature.
5. **GRPO beside the ladder.** RFT plateaus in 2607.07646v1, and the ladder is RFT. "Mirage or Method?" predicts
   negative-only gains will not reach C, where base pass@k is low.
6. **Amplification null and diversity tracking:** the per-round share against Tsilivis's recursion, and per-theorem
   proof diversity (Wang).
7. **EDL shape test** from existing per-checkpoint log p. Low priority: its theory is SFT-only.

## Pre-registered expectations vs outcomes (`d024bd0e`)

| # | expected | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | no LLM study shows RL beyond base at k ≥ 1,024 with a likelihood check | **held**. 2607.07646v1 has the k-1,024 half from scratch, with no likelihoods |
| 2 | ProRL rests on format-weak tasks | **held, partly**: conceded for Reasoning Gym; other tasks not checked |
| 3 | ≥ 2 new controlled-pretraining + RL papers | **held**: 2607.07646, 2510.11495, 2509.22613, 2601.15158 |
| 4 | out-of-support evidence only from tabula-rasa search and Go-Explore / count methods | **partly falsified**: heuristic injection, oracle prefixes and LLM evolution also qualify. The "no bonus measures support at k ≥ 1,024" half held |
| 5 | ≤ 4 brief families have coverage control + RL; ours at least as controlled | **held** (grammar, graph, parity, FOL) |
| 6 | ≥ 90 % of re-checked claims verify | **held**: 33 / 33 |
| 7 | ≥ 1 of our own claims mis-stated | **not met as an error**: three qualifications only (E1 noise, E2 placement, the per-step bound in `lit-review` §c item 1, which is sequence-level in coverage terms) |
