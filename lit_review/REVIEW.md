# Literature review: techniques we have not tried yet (run `lit-review`, 2026-09-29)

Run brief: nd-rl `docs/proposals/literature/BRIEF_lit-review.md`. Pre-registration:
`preregistration/lit-review.md` (commit `dae83e61`, 03:22 UTC, before any screening). 58 papers screened,
23 read in depth (notes in `lit_review/notes/`). Sources are arXiv HTML or PDF text fetched with
`lit_review/fetch.py` into `~/lr_sources/` (kept out of git). Every quote below gives the id, version and
location, and `python3 lit_review/quote.py <id> '<regex>'` prints it back in context.

**Which models "here" means.** The bottleneck numbers are inherited, not re-measured.
- **SN / S**: 3,216,384-parameter `lean_staten` / `lean_state` GPTs, from scratch, trained on
  `data/p2/train_depth3_f0_a1.jsonl` (155k, cap 6), Stage-1 seeds s0–s5 (`state-frontier`).
- **C0**: 3,214,336-parameter `lean_seq`, trained on the same set (`lean-format` s0/s1).
- The `L_true` labels are ND-derived upper bounds under Lean.

## Bottom line

1. **Nobody has run the ExIt experiment we can run.** Across the search papers, none shows that *search as
   the expert* trains a better policy than *sampling as the expert* at matched compute, with the policy
   then evaluated without search.
   - ExIt's own comparison is against REINFORCE in Hex.
   - TS-LLM's comparison is one unmatched run: 47.9 vs 47.5 (2309.17179v2 Table 4).
   - The state env built in proposal 13 makes that experiment cheap. It is also the most direct literature
     test of "search creates capability", so it ranks first.
2. **Our curriculum has tried *allocation* but not *supply*.** Ladder-A's difficulty weighting (T2) and
   moving window (T4) are learnability sampling in the LILO / online-filtering sense (`ladder_ei.allocate`,
   `ladder_ei.py:60`), and neither moved the frontier. That result is from ladder-A (2026-09-18): the token-format `stage1_abs.pt`, judged by `nd_verify`, before the Lean-only rule. Cross-seed sharing (T6) is Lee et al.'s cross-seed
   pooling. What the literature adds is *new targets just past the frontier* (STP, Lee et al.,
   Goedel-Prover-V2), and we have none.
3. **The cheapest high-value item is a measurement, not a technique:** score every EI-found proof of a
   base-unreached theorem step by step under the base model. It answers the open "new moves vs compounding
   reliability" question from files already on disk (§c).

## (a) Ranked shortlist

| # | technique | source (verified location) | bottleneck | plugs in | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Search as the EI expert** in the state env: best-first on length-normalised log-prob, training only on the minimal proof of every solved node; truncate-and-resume as the no-search baseline | BFS-Prover 2502.03438v3 Eq. 1 `score = Σ log p / L^α`, Table 1 70.83 %; HTPS 2205.11491v1 Table 4 (minimal proofs of all solved nodes 78.1 vs all proofs 40.6, Equations) and §7.2.1 "always leads to improved performance"; InternLM2.5-StepProver 2410.15700v2 §3.2 (BF finds proofs of mean length 1.66 vs 4.44 with a critic); ExIt 1705.08439v4 §6.1 | B1, B2 | new `search_generate` next to `state_sample.env_generate` (`state_sample.py:34`); `Env` (`state_env.py:172`) needs a clone (or replay via `decompose`, :512); the sampler must return per-action log-probs (`sample.generate_ids_fast`, `sample.py:131`, discards them); called from `state_ladder_ei.generate` (:51) | ≈ 1 executor session of code; 12 state ladders ≈ 25–35 pod-h ≈ $12–18 (A40 billed $0.49/h in `state-frontier`) |
| 2 | **Frontier target supply**: extend or mutate solved proofs, and take the open subgoals of failed attempts; keep targets whose current-model p̂ ∈ (0, 1/4] | STP 2502.00212v4 §3.2 (keep conjectures with P̂ ∈ (0,1/4]); abstract (28.5 % vs "13.2 % achieved through expert iteration", an earlier paper's number); Lee et al. 2502.01612v2 §7.1 ("too difficult … is detrimental"); Goedel-Prover-V2 2508.03613v1 §2.2 (`extract_goal` on unsolved states); Firoiu 2103.03798v2 §5 (fixed generator saturates) | B1 | new mutation script beside `gen.Gen` (`gen.py:66`); p̂ from the fast sampler; targets fed to `state_ladder_ei` / `ladder_ei` target lists; open goals from `Env` at failure (`state_sample.py:73–79`) | small code; ≈ $10–15 |
| 3 | **Support-expanding GRPO advantages**: unlikeliness rank penalty; pass@k advantage; distinct-proof bonus as a third arm | He et al. 2506.02355v2 §4.1 (β_rank 0.25), Table 2 (8,065 / 9,600 training problems vs 7,860 GRPO, 7,707 static); Chen et al. 2508.10751v1 Table 1 (Enigmata pass@1/pass@k 12.9/21.3 → 17.9/29.8); PKPO 2505.15201v5 Tables 5–6; Darling 2509.02534v1 §5 | B2 | one line: `adv = R - R.mean(1)` at `grpo.py:117` | ≈ $10–20 (18 GRPO runs + support curves) |
| 4 | **Transductive EI on textbook theorems plus programmatic variants** | HTPS §7.1.3 (Identities 91.3 %, "while a supervised model never exceeds 36 %"); AlphaProof (Nature, DOI 10.1038/s41586-025-09833-y) Methods TTRL, "programmatically created variants", ED Fig. 3b "More synthetic variants consistently improves the final prove rate" | B4, B2 | a variant generator (drop / strengthen a hypothesis, split a conjunctive goal, sub-lemmas); targets passed to `state_ladder_ei` | ≈ $8–15 |
| 5 | **A steps-to-go value token**, trained from free labels, used as the search score | AlphaProof Methods: value "−T_steps", reward −1 per tactic "to incentivize the discovery of the shortest proof"; Polu 2022 2202.01344v1 §4.3.2 (proofsize buckets); HTPS Table 5 (soft critic 78.1 vs hard 63.1 vs none 65.6: a bad value is worse than none); Minimo 2407.00695v2 App. A (8.45 M model with a value token) | B1 | extra head or `VALUE` token in `model.GPT.forward` (`model.py:103`; `load_ckpt` :128 is strict) and in `fast_train.packed_logits` (`fast_train.py:225`, a second copy of the forward); labels from `state_env.decompose` | ≈ 1 session; ≈ $5–10 after #1 |
| 6 | **EI data selection**: least-likely correct proof per theorem (He et al.'s mechanism ported to EI), set against the already-proposed shortest-proof rule | He et al. §3.4 (the pass@N gain comes from solutions with p₀ ≈ 1/N); HTPS Table 4 | B2 | the per-theorem choice under `--max_per_thm` in `ladder_ei.py` / `state_ladder_ei.py` | one flag; ≈ $5 |

**1. Search as the EI expert.**
- *Mechanism.* A priority queue over (theorem, state) nodes. Expand the best node with w sampled steps and
  push the children. With α > 0 the queue stops penalising depth. The tree yields many proofs per solved
  node, and HTPS trains only on the minimal ones.
- *Why here.* Independent sampling almost never finds two proofs of a hard theorem, so neither our proposed
  shortest-proof rule nor HTPS's minimal-proof rule has anything to act on without search. The open question
  is B2: does search-found data extend what the apprentice reaches without search?
- *Smallest test.* Six SN Stage-1 seeds (s0–s5 exist), each run through two 8-round T1 ladders from the same
  checkpoint: sampling EI vs best-first EI (α = 1, width 4) at an equal number of generated actions.
  Evaluate both apprentices *without search* at k = 256 on `transfer_long` rr600, generator-only bins. Run a
  third arm, truncate-and-resume (restart from the state before the failing step, DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5
  2408.08152v1 §3.1), on 2 seeds as the cheap baseline.
- *Expectation.* Best-first apprentice `L*` ≥ sampling apprentice + 1 in ≥ 5 of 6 pairs, and the mean
  `L_true` of found proofs is higher at α = 1 than at α = 0.
- *Falsifier.* The difference is ≤ 0 in ≥ 3 of 6 pairs.
- *Seeds.* `NOISE_FLOOR.md`'s nearest quantity is the frozen-ladder transfer `L*`: sd 0.354, MDD 2 points at
  n = 2 and 1.794 × 0.354 = 0.63 at n = 6, so a 1-point difference is resolvable only at n ≈ 6. The pairing
  removes the Stage-1 component, about 99 % of the variance. `transfer_long` has no measured floor, so a
  re-sample of one arm at a second sampling seed is part of the run.

**2. Frontier target supply.**
- *Mechanism.* EI gets signal only where p̂ > 0. The fixed pool has almost none past `L*`, and reallocating
  attempts inside it (T2 / T4) did not help. New targets built by extending proofs the model already solves
  sit just past the frontier by construction.
- *Test.* Six SN seeds, T1 vs T1 + supply. Supply = 32 attempts per candidate at `L_true` `L*`+1 … +4; keep
  targets with p̂ ∈ (0, 1/4].
- *Expectation.* ≥ 5 % of candidates pass the filter, and `L*` rises by ≥ 1 in ≥ 5 of 6 pairs.
- *Falsifier.* Under 5 % pass the filter (supply fails, which is the memory note's "generator cannot make
  run-2 shapes" risk), or `L*` does not move. Same floor as #1.

**3. Support-expanding advantages.**
- *Mechanism.* GRPO shifts mass toward already-likely correct samples ("rank bias", He et al. Fig. 4). The
  unlikeliness penalty and the pass@k advantage move credit to rare correct proofs.
- *Caveats.*
  - Every variant except negative-only reinforcement (2506.01347v2) gives zero gradient on all-fail groups,
    so any gain on base-unreached theorems has to come from transfer.
  - No paper evaluates beyond k = 512.
  - He et al.'s "outperforms expert iteration" has no experiment behind it in either version.
  - `grpo.py` is whole-proof only.
- *Test.* Six new C0-style Stage-1 seeds (≈ 6.5 pod-min each). Arms: GRPO default, unlikeliness, pass@4
  advantage, and distinct-proof bonus. Read out with the `support-curves` protocol: base-unreached theorems
  reached at equal attempts, paired per theorem.
- *Expectation.* Unlikeliness and pass@k reach ≥ 1.2× the default's base-unreached theorems in ≥ 5 of 6
  seeds, at a held-out greedy cost ≤ 2 pp.
- *Falsifier.* Otherwise. Raw solve-count floors are 167–257 % at n = 2, so use paired per-theorem readouts.

**4. Transductive EI on textbook theorems.**
- *Why.* In the `long-pool` re-read, textbook theorems were solved 10 times in 73 × 14 theorem-model reads.
  HTPS's Identities result is this exact shift (generated statements → book identities).
- *Test.* Split the 282 textbook theorems in `transfer_long` in half. Arms: frozen at equal attempts; EI on
  half A; EI on half A + variants. Report half A (transductive) and half B (transfer) separately. 6 SN seeds.
- *Expectation.* The variants arm solves ≥ 2× EI-only on half A, and more than the frozen control on half B.
- *Falsifier.* Variants ≤ EI-only.

**5. Value token.**
- *Test.* Only after #1. Compare best-first scored by log-prob against log-prob + steps-to-go value, at equal
  expansions, on the 29 survivors and on bins 13–16.
- *Expectation.* ≥ 1.5× solves at `L_true` ≥ 14.
- *Falsifier.* Value ≤ no value, as with HTPS's hard targets.

**6. EI data selection.** Three arms on 6 SN seeds: shortest / least-likely / random proof per theorem.
- *Expectation.* The least-likely arm raises distinct base-unreached theorems reached.
- *Falsifier.* No pairwise difference beyond the re-sample spread.

## (b) Considered and rejected

| technique | source | reason |
|---|---|---|
| Learnability / p(1−p) target sampling, SEC bandit, PLR | 2502.12272v6 Alg. 2; 2505.14970v4 Table 1; 2010.03934v4 | Already done in substance: ladder-A T2 difficulty weighting and T4 window, with no frontier gain. At frontier p ≈ 1e-5, p(1−p) ≈ p. A uniform-over-bins control is still cheap. |
| Cross-seed pooling of EI data | Lee et al. 2502.01612v2 §5.1 | Done as ladder-A T6. |
| Learned conjecturer head | STP; Minimo | STP's conjecturer is a pretrained 7B LM. Minimo's from-scratch conjecturer found proofs of ≤ 11 steps (§5), below our `L*`. #2 gets the filter without training a generator. |
| Position coupling, Abacus, index hints, RASP-L formats, looped transformers | 2405.20671, 2405.17399, 2310.16028, 2409.15647 | Digit-alignment tricks. Our `n<k>` offset names already act as index hints. Looping needs the step count at training time (2409.15647v5 §7). |
| NoPE instead of RoPE | 2305.19466v2 | Cheap but low value: `L*` stalls in the state arms too, where context length is not the constraint. Keep only as a 6-seed Stage-1 side arm if a pod is idle. |
| Stream of Search, Searchformer | 2404.03683v1, 2402.14083v2 | Need long serialised traces (4,096-token contexts); the gain is over optimal-path imitation, which is not our bottleneck. |
| Self-correction from error messages (Goedel-V2, Seed-Prover, Kimina, Lean-STaR) | 2508.03613v1 §3.5; 2507.23726v2; 2504.11354v1; 2407.10040v5 | Need a pretrained LLM that reads Lean messages. Goedel-V2: removing compiler feedback "significantly lowers performance". |
| RMaxTS as a standalone arm | 2408.08152v1 Table 3 (58.4 → 59.6) | Test-time only, about 1 point, never used as the training expert. |
| DPO from compiler errors | BFS-Prover §2.3 | 70.38 → 70.83 is inside its ±0.89. |
| Entropy regularisers (Clip-Cov / KL-Cov, clip-higher, forking tokens) | 2505.22617v1; 2503.14476v2; 2506.01939v2 | Clip-higher is already proposed (DAPO). The others are tuned for long CoT at 7B–32B; #3 addresses the same collapse more directly. |
| First-error process reward | 2606.20068v1 ablation table: outcome + tactic 59.2 % vs outcome-only GRPO 57.9 % (MiniF2F pass@64, ± 0.5, 7B) | A +1.3-point gain at 7B, within about 2.6 σ of its own error bars, and far below any floor we could resolve. Our env already ends attempts at the first invalid step. |
| Online asynchronous HTPS / ABEL training | ABEL App. C Fig. 2 | Needs distributed prover and trainer infrastructure. The proposed "EI to 24 rounds" is the cheap proxy. |

## (c) Measuring create vs elicit

1. **Per-step base likelihood of newly reached proofs** (do first; $0–1, no sampling).
   - *What.* For each theorem EI reaches and its base did not in 400k attempts (`support-curves`, `support-state`),
     score the found proof under the base: total, minimum and mean per-step log-probability.
   - *How to read it.* Compounding reliability predicts no step near zero. New moves predict at least one step
     below the ε ≈ 3/400k ≈ 7.5e-6 bound. The bound follows Invisible Leash 2507.14843v4 App. C.4, with
     ζ = 0.05; the arithmetic is ours.
   - *Also report* its SRR / NDR (§4.2: all 1.5B–14B models "SRR ≈ 0.93–0.99", "NDR ≤ 0.04").
2. **Power-sampling null.**
   - *What.* Sample the base under p^α with Karan & Du's MCMC (2510.14901v1 Alg. 1) at matched tokens. Their
     Table 1 has it matching GRPO on MATH500 (0.748 vs 0.785) at 8.84× the tokens.
   - *How to read it.* If it recovers EI's new theorems, EI is sharpening. It cannot reach low-likelihood
     proofs (their Fig. 5), so read it together with item 1.
3. **Mode-share tracking per seed during EI and GRPO.** Echo Chamber (2504.07912v2) finds RL "amplifies a
   specific mode from the pretraining mixture while collapsing the others" in from-scratch models. Track
   the share of proofs by style (depth-3 pattern or not) round by round. This may explain the bimodal seeds.
4. **Textbook dose study for B4.** Interplay (2512.07783v1 §4) finds that RL transfers to a new context only
   when it made up ≥ 1 % of pre-training; at 0 % and 0.1 % it does not. Use Stage-1 mixes with 0 / 0.1 / 1 /
   10 % textbook-style theorems (≥ 6 seeds per dose), then identical EI.
5. **Init-seed vs data-order seed.** Zhou et al. 2402.09371v1 §4.2 find "significant variance across training
   data orders even when the weight initialization is constant". A 3 × 3 Stage-1 grid (≈ $1) would tell
   `NOISE_FLOOR.md`'s per-run component apart.

## Pre-registered expectations vs outcomes

| # | expected | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | search as the EI expert ranks first | **held** |
| 2 | learnability curriculum in the top 3 | **falsified**: already done as T2 / T4; *supply* ranks 2 instead |
| 3 | positional-encoding techniques rank low | **held** (rejected) |
| 4 | pass@k objectives shortlisted, below search | **held** (#3) |
| 5 | ≥ 1 of the brief's identifiers wrong | **falsified**: every arXiv id was right. Corrections were to metadata only: 2509.06941 authors are Song, Kempe, Munos; 2502.12272v6 is titled "LILO: …" in its PDF; AlphaGeometry and ABEL have no arXiv id |
| 6 | ≥ 90 % of cited claims verify | **held**: the agents' ledgers list ≈ 240 claims with 14 marked unverified or partial (§d notes). My independent re-check of 33 claims (list in §d): 32 verified. AlphaProof's Table 1 TTRL percentages were not in my text copy, so they are not cited |

## (d) Screened papers

58 papers, more than the brief's 25–40, because the cluster agents followed citations. The *claims verified*
column is the screening agent's own record. The claim ledgers themselves are in its notes and in `~/lr_out/`
(not committed).
