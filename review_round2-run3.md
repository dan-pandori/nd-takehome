# Review of round2-run3 (minimum outside data for ignition)

Reviewer session, independent of the executor. Phase 1 (this section) was written from the run brief
(`BRIEF_ROUND2.md` §Run 3), the pre-registration (log.md as committed in 734d51f, 22:14:24 UTC, *before* the
first run-3 pod job), the code, the data and the raw artefacts only — no executor write-up (`run3.md`,
`numbers.md` §Run 3, `STATUS.md`, `artifacts/r3/summary*.json`, figures) was read before it was committed.
All counts below come from my own code: `review_run3_recount.py` and `review_run3_splits.py` (own proof
parser, own dependency pruning, own start-index normaliser, own box-depth counter and reductio predicate, own
atom-renaming key — the reviewer's module from the run-5 review, `review_run5_recount.py`). Only `nd_verify`
is shared with the executor. Machine-readable outputs: `artifacts/review_r3/recount.json`, `splits.json`.

## Recount

### Hard constraints

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `nd_verify` unmodified | tree hash of `nd_verify/` at HEAD = `origin/main` (9437bb7); sha256 of both files identical in the repo and in the review copy |
| `artifacts/TEST_RUN_DONE` | byte-identical to `origin/main` (Sep 15 07:38, one test run) |
| evaluation files in training code | `train.py`: only `--data`. `expert_iter.py` reads the target / transfer / held-out pools and `validation_36` only for sampling, tracking and the (unused) relabel exclusion set. `run3_inject.py` reads one outside file per condition: for `sib*` a *sibling arm's `found_4.jsonl`*, i.e. verified RL proofs of theorems of the **same target pool** (see "Injected records"); for `gen4` / `other4` / `inv4` the four-record files in `data/r3/`. Nothing else from an evaluation file enters training. **OK by the brief's design** (sibling proofs are the brief's condition (a)); the fact that the sibling theorems are targets must be stated in the write-up |
| cap 6 on supervised data | both Stage-1 sets: 155,000 proofs, lengths 2–6 exactly 31,000 each, max 6, 0 violations. The injection step (`train.py --cap 0`, the EI round recipe) trains on 7–8-line sibling proofs and, in `inv4`, on 4 verifier-rejected strings (×4) — see flag below |
| hand-written / LLM-written training proofs | `gen4` / `other4`: generator output (`src: generator_*`), all 8 records verify, my key = stored key. `inv4`: 8 generator proofs with **one citation index edited** (`src: invalid_*`, verifier reason stored and reproduced by me); they are not proofs. The code that produced `data/r3/*.jsonl` is not in the repository (commit 3ef50a4 contains only the four files and `peek_samples.py`); the files themselves are committed and are 16 records in total |
| pre-registration before the first pod job | expectations R3-E1…E4 committed 22:14:24 UTC (734d51f); the first two injection manifests were written at 22:14:41 and 22:14:46, the first injected-step checkpoints at 22:15:29 / 22:15:37 (file mtimes preserved by the pull). Injection files committed 22:09:25 (3ef50a4). **Met, by 17 s** |

**Flag, not a quarantine.** The five `inv4` checkpoints (`ckpts/r3/*_inv4_*`) were fine-tuned on invalid strings.
The brief prescribes this control and the standard EI recipe already runs `train.py --cap 0` (no verification),
so nothing was weakened to make it runnable; but these models must not be used as submission models or quoted
as take-home results. The 25 other arms trained only on verifier-accepted proofs.

### Split disjointness (my renaming key, atoms relabelled by first appearance)

| file | classes | my key = stored `key` | ∩ targets_depth3 | ∩ transfer_depth3 | ∩ targets_reductio2 | ∩ transfer_reductio2 | ∩ heldout | ∩ val-36 |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| train_depth3_f0_a1 | 155,000 | – | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| train_reductio_f0 | 155,000 | – | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| targets_depth3 | 1,000 | ✓ | – | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| transfer_depth3 | 500 | ✓ | | – | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| targets_reductio2 | 606 | ✓ | | | – | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| transfer_reductio2 | 300 | ✓ | | | | – | 0 | 0 |

### Pattern frequency in the Stage-1 sets (my predicates, dependency-pruned)

| set | depth ≥ 3 | reductio |
|---|---:|---:|
| train_depth3_f0_a1 | **0** | 10,547 (6.8 %) |
| train_reductio_f0 | 5,687 (3.7 %) | **0** |

So f = 0 holds exactly for each arm's own pattern. Note for the `other4` control: the "other" pattern is
*not* novel for these models (the depth-3 set holds 10,547 reductio proofs; the reductio set 5,687 depth-3
proofs). `other4` therefore controls for "one extra fine-tuning step on four valid outside proofs", not for
"a second unseen pattern".

### Injected records (all 30 manifests; my verifier run, my predicates, my keys)

| condition | n | verifier-valid | has the arm's pattern | theorems are **targets** of the arm's pool | in transfer / held-out / val-36 | class in the arm's Stage-1 set | pattern proof in the mix | notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| sib1 / sib4 / sib16 (depth-3, from a1 s2 `found_4`) | 1 / 4 / 16 | all | all | **all** (1 / 4 / 16) | 0 | 0 | 7–8-line RL proofs | executor's manifest flags agree |
| sib1 / sib4 / sib16 (reductio, from s7 `found_4`) | 1 / 4 / 16 | all | all | **all** (1 / 4 / 16) | 0 | 0 | 7–8-line RL proofs | same |
| gen4 (depth-3 / reductio) | 4 | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6-line generator proofs | `data/r3/inject_*_gen4.jsonl` |
| other4 (depth-3 arms ← reductio gen4; reductio arms ← depth-3 gen4) | 4 | 4 | 0 (4 of the other pattern) | 0 | 0 | 1 of 4 (depth-3 arms) / 0 | | |
| inv4 (depth-3) | 4 | **0** | 4 (three box bars, IMPI chain intact) | 0 | 0 | 0 | | reasons: bad box cite ×3, ref out of range ×1 |
| inv4 (reductio) | 4 | **0** | 4 (AS ~G … NEGI … DN intact) | 0 | 0 | 2 of 4 | | reasons: bad box cite ×1, IMPE ×1, NEGE ×2 |

Two facts about the injections that the pre-registration states differently:

1. **The sibling theorems are targets.** The pre-registration says "the injected theorems are not targets".
   That is true of `gen4` / `other4` / `inv4` (class-disjoint from targets, transfer, held-out and val-36) and
   false of every `sib*` arm: the sibling files are `found_4.jsonl` of arms run on the *same* pool, so each
   `sib*` arm receives 1 / 4 / 16 verified proofs of its own targets. Every injected theorem is then re-found
   by the arm (injected acquired = 1 / 4 / 16 in all 15 sibling arms). The tables below therefore also give
   the counts **excluding the injected theorems**; the largest correction is 16 of 344 (depth-3) and 16 of
   80–95 (reductio).
2. **The invalid strings are one token from a valid proof.** Each of the 8 `inv4` records has exactly one
   single-token substitution of a citation index that makes it verify (my exhaustive search over all
   citation tokens × all line indices: 1 repair each; e.g. `IMPI N2 N5` → `IMPI N1 N5`). Box bars, formulas,
   rule sequence and 5 of 6 citations are those of a correct pattern proof. The brief asked for "the
   pattern's surface tokens but invalid structure"; what was injected is valid structure with an invalid
   citation. The control therefore tests whether the *verifier's acceptance* of the injected example matters,
   not whether its *structure* matters.

Sibling sources: a1 s2 `found_4.jsonl` = 10,202 records = 602 distinct start-index-normalised proofs, 284 with
depth ≥ 3 on 239 theorems (the pre-registration's "3,099 depth-3 proofs" counts start-index variants; 239
theorems agrees); reductio s7 `found_4.jsonl` = 1,902 records = 51 distinct proofs, all reductio, 51 theorems.

### Parents (the round-4 states) and their base rates

| arm | Stage-1 pre-RL pattern hits in 600k samples on 300 targets (ignition study's coverage files, as reproduced by the ignition review) | parent's cumulative pattern theorems, rounds 1…8 (my recount) | round-4 state |
|---|---|---|---|
| depth3 a1 s4 | 1 (1.7·10⁻⁶) | 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 | 0 pattern theorems; 232 targets solved (910 proofs in the mix) |
| depth3 a1 s5 | 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0; 247 solved (968) |
| depth3 a1 s3 | 0 | 0 0 **1 3** 28 166 265 295 | **3 pattern theorems already found and trained on** at round 4; 233 solved (916) |
| reductio s1 | 0 (0 valid proofs of any kind) | 0 … 0 | Stage-1 model, empty found set |
| reductio s2 | 0 (0 valid proofs of any kind) | 0 … 0 | Stage-1 model, empty found set |

The pre-registration describes s3 as "0 pattern theorems at round 4 but self-ignited at round 5". Its round-4
found file holds 3 pattern theorems (first at round 3) and its round-4 fine-tune included them, so s3's
round-4 state is not a zero-pattern state: every one of its six conditions, including `other4` and `inv4`,
ignites at round 5 (42 / 45 pattern theorems against the parent's 28). s3 is a reference, as pre-registered,
not a fifth test of injection. The tests are s4, s5, s1, s2.

### Arms × conditions (identical continuation: rounds 5–8, k = 32, T = 0.8, retain 20k, resumed own found set)

Per target: pattern theorem = ≥ 1 verified proof whose dependency-pruned form has the pattern (my predicate);
round = first per-round file the (name, normalised proof) appears in (resumed round-≤ 4 proofs keep the
parent's round). Round 4 = the parent's resumed `found_4`. Ignition = cumulative ≥ 20 (depth-3) / ≥ 12
(reductio), as pre-registered. Every distinct pattern proof re-verified against its prompt with `nd_verify`;
200 random non-pattern proofs per arm likewise (0 failures anywhere). Per-round files are nested
(found_5 ⊆ … ⊆ found_8), the resumed records equal the parent's `found_4` exactly, the `round` field agrees
with first appearance for every proof, 0 unparsable proofs, and my cumulative solved counts equal the
executor's `round_<r>.json` at every round in all 30 arms.

Notes on the table. Every reductio proof found is a pattern proof (solved = pattern theorems in all 12
reductio arms), as in every earlier reductio run. Held-out greedy stays at the parents' level (0.870–0.902)
in all arms, including the `inv4` ones — training on four invalid strings did not damage the models.
Ignition rounds are insensitive to the threshold: at 10 / 20 / 40 (depth-3) they change in two cells by one
round (s4 gen4 → 7 at 40; s5 sib1 → 6 at 40); at 6 / 12 / 24 (reductio) s1 sib1 is 5 / 6 / 6 and s2 inv4
is 8 / 8 / never. Excluding the injected theorems moves no ignition round except s1 sib1 at threshold 6.

**Comparison with the ignition study's full-sibling injection (ivS: the sibling's whole `found_4`, 239 / 51
theorems; my recount of those files).** Depth-3 s4 / s5 / s3: ivS 286 / 300 / 297 pattern theorems at round 5
and 330 / 335 / 336 at round 8. So: 16 proofs give 236 / 143 / 201 at round 5 and 344 / 312 / 344 at round 8
(the plateau, reached one round later); 4 proofs 105 / 91 / 101 → 322 / 316 / 326; 1 proof 8 / 23 / 69 →
264 / 262 / 322 (still rising at round 8). Reductio: 16 proofs 80 / 95 at round 8, 64 / 79 excluding the
injected 16, against 0.11–0.18 for the full injection in the ignition study.

**Transfer (never trained on).** The pattern generalises to the transfer pool in every igniting arm:
depth-3 sib1 137 / 133 of 500 at round 8, gen4 88 / 118, inv4 (s4) 127; reductio sib1 17 / 30 of 300,
gen4 (s2) 30, inv4 (s2) 6. 0 in every non-igniting arm.

**Reductio s2 `inv4` (the one marginal cell).** 14 / 606 at round 8, first proof at round 6, threshold
crossed at round 8 exactly. The executor's log (00:20) records that the first attempt of this very job
(same command, same seed; killed in the pod's OOM window and deleted) had 6 / 47 pattern theorems at rounds
5–6, against 0 / 1 in the surviving rerun. Two runs of the same seed thus differ by 46 theorems at round 6;
the surviving one is the one on file. The condition is at the edge of igniting for s2, and 0 for s1.

### Pre-registered expectations (734d51f, 22:14 UTC) against my values

| id | expectation | my value | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| R3-E1 | `sib16` ignites 5 / 5 by round 5 or 6 and reaches the plateau (depth-3 ≥ 0.30, reductio ≥ 0.10); `sib4` ignites ≥ 4 / 5; `sib1` ≥ 2 / 5 | sib16: 5 / 5 at round 5; r8 0.344 / 0.312 / 0.344 and 0.132 / 0.157 (0.328 / 0.296 / 0.328 and 0.106 / 0.130 excluding the injected 16) ✓; sib4 5 / 5 (all round 5) ✓; sib1 5 / 5 (rounds 6, 5, 5, 6, 5) | **met**, sib1 stronger than allowed |
| R3-E2 | `gen4` ignites ≥ 3 / 5; depth-3 more likely than reductio | depth-3 s4 (r6), s5 (r6), s3 (r5, reference); reductio s2 (r6), s1 never → 4 / 5 (3 / 4 tests) ✓; depth-3 2 / 2 vs reductio 1 / 2 ✓ | **met** |
| R3-E3 | `other4` ignites 0 / 5 (s3 excepted) | s4, s5, s1, s2: 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 pattern theorems through round 8; s3 ignites (294) | **met** |
| R3-E4 | `inv4` ignites 0 / 5; "if it ignites, what transfers is token statistics, not valid structure" | s4 ignites (252, r6), s5 never, s1 never, s2 14 at round 8 (marginal, same-seed replicate disagreed), s3 reference. 1 clear + 1 marginal of 4 tests | **wrong** for depth-3 s4; the pre-registered interpretation does not follow — the strings carry valid structure with one bad citation (above) |

### Reproducibility

`python3 review_run3_recount.py` and `python3 review_run3_splits.py` in the repository root regenerate every
number above from `artifacts/r3/`, `artifacts/p2/` (manifests, sibling and parent found files), `data/r3/`,
`data/p2/` and `targets/`; outputs in `artifacts/review_r3/`. Checkpoint provenance was read from the 56
`ckpts/r3/*.pt` files' stored training arguments (without torch): every `_r4t` was trained from the
parent's round-4 checkpoint (reductio: the Stage-1 model) on its manifest's mix for 600 steps at lr 3·10⁻⁴,
`--cap 0`, seed s·1000 + 4; every `_r8` from its own `_r7` on `mix_8.jsonl`. The 12 reductio mix files on disk
contain exactly the manifest's records ×4 plus 20,000 Stage-1 records (the 18 depth-3 mix files were not
pulled). Not re-derived: the pre-RL coverage counts (taken from the ignition study's summary, which the
ignition review reproduced), pod spend, kill-switch timing, and the bucket contents beyond the existence of
`round2/run3/{artifacts,ckpts,data}` (01:05 UTC).
