# Review of round2-run2 (six new patterns, classes pre-registered)

Reviewer session, independent of the executor. Phase 1 (this section) was written from the run brief
(`BRIEF_ROUND2.md` §Run 2), the pre-registration as committed (log.md in 5b3b257, 19:45:07 UTC, before any set was
assembled; the cap-8 addendum in 73cd145, 22:51:24 UTC), the code, the data and the raw artefacts only — no executor
write-up (`run2.md`, `numbers.md` §Run 2, `STATUS.md`, `artifacts/r2/summary*.json`, `analysis_*.log`, figures) was
read before this section was committed. Extracting the two pre-registration entries from the committed log did expose
me to the executor's two adjacent progress lines (22:12 "first arms 0 / 500", 22:52 "controls"); every number below is
nevertheless my own recount. All counts come from `review_run2_recount.py` (own proof parser, own dependency pruning,
own start-index normaliser, own atom-renaming key — the reviewer's module from the run-5 review — and own predicates
for the six patterns, written from the pre-registration's one-line definitions and self-tested against verifier-checked
hand-built proofs). Only `nd_verify` is shared with the executor. Machine-readable outputs: `artifacts/review_r2/`
(`sets.json`, `pools.json`, `arms_ei_.json`, `arms_frozen_.json`, `cov.json`, `ckpts.json`).

## Recount

### Hard constraints

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `nd_verify` unmodified | tree hash of `nd_verify/` at HEAD = `origin/main` (9437bb7); sha256 of both files identical in the repo and in the review copy |
| `artifacts/TEST_RUN_DONE` | byte-identical to the Sep 15 07:38 commit (one test run) |
| cap 6 on supervised data | the four cap-6 Stage-1 sets (`struct`, `impi_ore_f0`, `negi_ande_hyp_f0`, `ori_ore_f0`): 155,000 proofs each, 31,000 per written length 2–6, max 6, 0 violations, 0 unparsable; 811 random records per set re-verified, 0 failures. Two **cap-8** sets are used by control arms only (`train_r2_c8_depth4_f0`: 154,994 = 22,142 × lengths 2–8, max 8; the campaign's `train_derived_ore_strict_f0_c8` for the `c8ctl` arms): outside the take-home's cap-6 rule, labelled as controls, not submission models. EI rounds train on 7–11-line RL proofs under the standard `--cap 0` recipe |
| hand-written / LLM-written training proofs | every training record is a generator-pool proof (`pool_cap6_recon`, `pool_cap8`); the two schema pools (`chain_pool.py`, `ore_pool.py`) feed **target** files only, and no arm ever found a proof there. Nothing outside the generator enters any mix |
| evaluation files in training code | `expert_iter.py` reads targets / transfer / held-out / val-36 for sampling, tracking and the (unused) relabel exclusion; the found target proofs are what EI trains on, by design. `coverage.py` and `necessity.py` write no training data |
| pre-registration before the first pod job | classes + expectations committed 19:45:07 (5b3b257); first target-generation log written 19:57; sets assembled 21:19–21:21; first Stage-1 checkpoint 21:44:51 (file mtimes preserved by the pull). **Met.** Cap-8 addendum committed 22:51:24 (73cd145); its set written 00:02, its Stage-1 checkpoints 00:13:00 / 00:13:05. **Met.** The four `c8ctl` / `natctl` control arms were queued ≈ 22:11 (job-file mtimes) and disclosed as "outside the pre-registration" in be90708 at 22:13:47, before their first checkpoint (22:26:18) — not pre-registered, correctly labelled |
| generator "unchanged" | `gen.py` is unchanged; `make_coverage_sets.py` gained a `--gen_max_depth` knob (default 3 = the take-home generator) used only for the depth-4 **target** pool (`--gen_max_depth 5`, `pod/r2/targets2.sh`); every Stage-1 set was drawn from the pre-existing pools. Matches the default stated in `QUESTIONS.md` |

### Split disjointness (my renaming key, atoms relabelled by first appearance)

| training set | classes | key field = my key | ∩ any run-2 targets / transfer (12 files) | ∩ heldout | ∩ heldout_c8 | ∩ val-36 |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| train_r2_struct | 155,000 | ✓ | **0** | 0 | 134 | 0 |
| train_r2_impi_ore_f0 | 155,000 | ✓ | **0** | 0 | 138 | 0 |
| train_r2_negi_ande_hyp_f0 | 155,000 | ✓ | **0** | 0 | 122 | 0 |
| train_r2_ori_ore_f0 | 155,000 | ✓ | **0** | 0 | 133 | 0 |
| train_r2_c8_depth4_f0 (cap 8) | 154,994 | ✓ | **0** | 142 | 0 | 0 |
| p2/train_derived_ore_strict_f0_c8 (cap 8, `c8ctl` parent, built Sep 16) | 154,994 | ✓ | depth-4 pools **0**; impi_ore 7 + 3, negi 1, ori_ore 1 + 1 | 101 | 0 | 0 |

The non-zero cells are harmless: each arm's greedy held-out set is the one its own training set excludes (`heldout`
for cap-6 arms, `heldout_c8` for cap-8 arms), and the `c8ctl` models were run on the depth-4 pool only. Cross-pool:
`targets_impi_ore` ∩ `targets_ori_ore` = 1 class (and 1 each in two transfer pairs), different arms; all six
targets ∩ transfer pairs = 0.

### Pattern frequency in the Stage-1 sets (my predicates, dependency-pruned; written form gives the same counts)

| set | depth4 | impe_chain4 | nested_ore | impi_ore | negi_ande_hyp | ori_ore |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| train_r2_struct (natural draw) | **0** | **0** | **0** | 130 (0.084 %) | 11 (0.007 %) | 36 (0.023 %) |
| train_r2_impi_ore_f0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** | 14 | 62 |
| train_r2_negi_ande_hyp_f0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 128 | **0** | 43 |
| train_r2_ori_ore_f0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 118 | 19 | **0** |
| train_r2_c8_depth4_f0 (cap 8) | **0** | 0 | 0 | 5,327 | 35 | 2,882 |
| p2/train_derived_ore_strict_f0_c8 (cap 8) | **0** | 0 | 0 | 4,919 | 33 | 72 |

So f = 0 holds exactly for each arm's own pattern, and the executor's assembly report reproduces to the proof. One
consequence for the controls: the campaign's cap-8 set contains **no** depth-4 proof either (the generator's box cap is
3, so no cap-8 pool proof has a fourth box). The `c8ctl` arms, described when queued as a "natural-rate" cap-8 control,
are therefore a second pair of **f = 0 depth-4 arms at cap 8**, the same condition as the addendum's `c8f0` arms.

### Target and transfer pools (own key, own predicate, every oracle proof re-verified)

| pool | targets / transfer | source | min-proof lines | required / uses-only (targets) | oracle proof verifies, has pattern | notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| depth4 | 500 / 200 | generator, box cap raised to 5 | 8: 269, 9: 53, 10: 178 | 176 / 324 | 500 / 500, 500 / 500 | `build_pools.sh` says `--mode requires`; the file's `mode` field is `uses` and 324 targets have a depth-≤ 3 proof within 10 lines. 473 / 500 have no premise; conclusions are right-nested implications of depth 4–6 and 377 / 500 end in an `( X > X )` identity: the theorems are "open four boxes, close four boxes" |
| impe_chain4 | 500 / 200 | 7 schemata (`chain_pool.py`) | 8: 110, 9: 246, 10: 144 | – / 500 (no restriction exists) | 500 / 500, 500 / 500 | `major_conj2` 110, `major_conj3` 82, `mixed` 82, `mixed2` 82, `minor_chain2` 80, `minor_chain` 60, `major_conj3b` 4 |
| nested_ore | **300 / 41** | 5 schemata (`ore_pool.py`) | 11: 113, 12: 172, 13: 15 | 300 / 0 (all required, bound 13) | 300 / 300, 300 / 300 | 343 required of 800 candidates, so the pool is 300 + 41 rather than the pre-registered 500 + 200 |
| impi_ore | 500 / 200 | generator | 7: 144, 8: 171, 9: 132, 10: 53 | 109 / 391 | 500 / 500, 500 / 500 | |
| negi_ande_hyp | **400 / 94** | generator (49 M tries for 807 candidates) | 7: 213, 8: 86, 9: 83, 10: 18 | 97 / 303 | 400 / 400, 400 / 400 | |
| ori_ore | **400 / 160** | generator, mode `gen` | 7: 310, 8: 81, 9: 8, 10: 1 | 0 / 0 | 400 / 400, **0** / 400 | the *generating* proof has the pattern (400 / 400 verify and have it); the shortest proof never does, by construction — a decoration control |

Every pool: my key = stored key and `thm` = prompt for every record; `n_lines` = `min_lines_ub` = verified length;
every record is present in its oracle file with the same labels. Oracle files (`nec_*.jsonl`): 0 timeouts in all six;
every `requires` record has the pattern in its unrestricted proof (my predicate) and every restricted proof lacks it;
all 80,618 oracle / restricted proofs verify. Base-reachability sampling used the **first 300 records of each shuffled
pool** (`coverage.py --limit 300`; length mix proportional to the pool), not "the 300 shortest" as pre-registered —
immaterial for the zero-rate arms, and the c8 arms' 300 include all three lengths.

### Arms (identical EI: 8 rounds, k = 32, T = 0.8, retain 20k, `max_per_thm` 4 × weight 4, 600 steps at 3·10⁻⁴)

Per target: pattern theorem = ≥ 1 verified proof whose dependency-pruned form has the pattern (my predicate; the
unpruned count is identical in every cell); round = first per-round file the (name, normalised proof) appears in.
Every distinct proof in every arm re-verified against its prompt (3,913 target and 1,688 transfer proofs, 0 failures;
0 unparsable), as were the 1,072 distinct coverage proofs (0 failures); per-round files nested, `round` field = first appearance everywhere; my cumulative solved count equals
the executor's `round_<r>.json` in every round of all 39 arms with files. Ignition = ≥ 2 % of targets with a pattern
proof (10 / 500, 8 / 400, 6 / 300), as pre-registered. Base = my recount of `cov_*.jsonl` (pass@2,000 on 300 targets
of the Stage-1 draw): theorems with a verified pattern proof / pattern hits per sample.

**Pre-registered arms (cap-6 Stage-1, f = 0 for the arm's pattern).**

Nine of the twelve pre-registered arms found no verified proof of any target in 256 attempts × 500 targets (the
generator-pool models' written frontier is 7–8 lines; the depth-4, chain and nested-ORE targets are 8–13 lines and
the impi_ore / negi targets 7–10). The one igniting arm, `negi_ande_hyp` s1, is the one draw with a non-zero pre-RL
rate (2 theorems, 3 hits in 600,000 samples); its frozen control at the same 256 attempts holds 2 theorems, EI reaches
59 (ignition round 5, first proof round 4), all 7–8-line proofs of **uses-only** targets (0 of the 97 required ones),
and the pattern reaches 12 of the 94 never-trained transfer theorems. `ori_ore` behaves as the decoration control it
was pre-registered to be: 0 pattern proofs anywhere, while EI raises plain solving from 148 / 173 (frozen) to 217 / 219.

**Controls outside the pre-registration (queued 22:11, disclosed 22:13) and the pre-registered addendum (`c8f0`).**

Reading the cap-8 rows: all four cap-8 Stage-1 draws were trained on sets with **zero** depth-4 proofs, yet each writes
verified depth-4 proofs at 11–20 % per sample before any RL (110–134 of 300 targets in 2,000 samples; frozen controls
150–202 of 500 at 256 attempts), and EI lifts that to 0.96–0.97 with every solved target solved *with* the pattern
(2 and 1 of the frozen controls' targets are solved by a depth-3 proof, all in the uses-only stratum; 0 in EI). The
written lengths are 8–11 lines. The same pattern at cap 6 is 0 in 600,000 pre-RL samples and 0 after RL in both
draws. The `natctl` rows are elicitation of a pattern present in the data at 130 / 155k (impi_ore: base 12–26 theorems
→ 95–111 with EI, ignition round 2) and near-absence at 11 / 155k (negi: one draw 0 → 0, the other 4 → 11).

**Drift measurement (pre-registered for zero-hit draws that ignite).** No zero-hit draw ignited. The only drift file
on disk is `drift_negi_ande_hyp_s1_r4` (28 pattern theorems, 8.6·10⁻³ per sample); the round-4 checkpoint was trained
on the arm's first pattern proof (found in round 4; `mix_4` holds 4 RL records), so this measures the state *after*
the first proof, not before it. The queued r1–r3 measurements (`pod/r2/drift_p2.txt`) have no output files and the
r1–r3 checkpoints of that arm were not pulled (`ckpts/r2/` holds `ei_negi_ande_hyp_s1_r4…r8` only).

### Pre-registered expectations (5b3b257 19:45; addendum 73cd145 22:51) against my values

| id | expectation | my value | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| depth4 — STRUCTURAL: acquired 2 / 2, ≥ 0.20 at r8, ignition by round 4; base ≈ 0 | base 0 / 0 (600k samples each); EI **0 / 500 and 0 / 500**; frozen 0 | **wrong** — not acquired at cap 6 from either draw |
| impe_chain4 — STRUCTURAL: 2 / 2 ≥ 0.20; base small non-zero | base 0 (s0's coverage file stopped at 96 theorems); EI 0 / 500 both; no proof of any chain target in 512k attempts | **wrong** |
| nested_ore — ≤ 0.02 both, base 0 (length-limited) | 0 / 300 both, base 0 | met (as a length limit; 11–13-line targets) |
| impi_ore — RULE SEQUENCE: ≈ 0 (≤ 0.05) unless pre-RL rate > 0 | base 0 / 0; EI 0 / 500 both | met, but uninformative: neither draw produced any valid proof of any target; the natural-rate control (`natctl`) elicits 0.19–0.22 from a base of 12–26 theorems |
| negi_ande_hyp — ≈ 0 from zero-rate draws; ≥ 1 of 2 draws with pre-RL rate > 0 → elicitation | s0: base 0 → 0; s1: base 3 hits / 600k → 0.147 (frozen 0.005) | **met exactly** |
| ori_ore — decoration control, ≤ 0.02, frozen ≈ EI | 0 pattern proofs in EI, frozen, base and transfer; EI solves 217 / 219 vs frozen 148 / 173 | met for the pattern; solving itself is not "frozen ≈ EI" |
| drift — zero-hit draws that ignite show rate > 0 on r2–r4 checkpoints before the first proof | no zero-hit draw ignited; the one drift file is post-first-proof | not testable from the files |
| addendum `c8f0` — cap 8 with depth-4 removed acquires depth 4 (≥ 0.20 in ≥ 1 of 2) if "structural repetition" is the rule; ≈ 0 with base 0 if a length margin is needed | 0.962 / 0.964, but **base 0.11–0.20 per sample and frozen 0.36** before any RL; the "removed" set had nothing to remove (cap-8 pool: 0 depth-4) | the stated outcome occurred, but its premise "base rate 0" did not: the fourth box is already generalised by Stage-1 at cap 8, so this is elicitation of a Stage-1 generalisation, not RL acquisition from zero |
| pools 500 + 200 per pattern | 500 + 200 for depth4, impe_chain4, impi_ore; 400 + 94, 300 + 41, 400 + 160 for negi, nested_ore, ori_ore | short, disclosed by the file sizes |
| budget ≈ $8, ceiling $50 | not derivable from files | – |

### Reproducibility

`python3 review_run2_recount.py` (sub-commands `sets`, `pools`, `arms`, `cov`, `ckpts`) in the repository root
regenerates every number above from `data/r2/`, `data/p2/`, `artifacts/r2/`, `ckpts/r2/` and `targets/`; outputs in
`artifacts/review_r2/`. Checkpoint provenance was read from the 24 `ckpts/r2/*.pt` files' stored training arguments
(without torch): every Stage-1 model from its named set at cap 6 (cap 8 for the two `c8` sets), 6,000 steps, seeds 0 / 1;
every `_r8` from its own `_r7` on `mix_8.jsonl` at `--cap 0`, seed s·1000 + 8; the two `c8ctl` parents are the
campaign's Sep 16 05:03 checkpoints trained on `train_derived_ore_strict_f0_c8`. Only round-8 checkpoints were pulled for
most arms (plus r4–r8 of `negi_ande_hyp` s1); the `mix_*.jsonl` files were not pulled, so the mixes are known only
through the `round_<r>.json` counts (RL records 0 in every round of the nine empty arms). Not re-derived: pod spend,
kill-switch timing, the executor's "hand check of ten targets per pattern" (I spot-checked two oracle proofs per
pattern by eye; all six patterns present as claimed), and the bucket contents beyond the existence of
`round2/run2/{artifacts,ckpts,data}` (uploaded 01:27 UTC). At 02:10 UTC no `p1`–`p4` pods exist on the account
(the ten running pods are `r4-*`, `r1-a100`, `la-*` — other runs' executors).
