# Review of round2-run1 (ND → Lean, in-context surface forms, novelty by scale)

Reviewer session, independent of the executor. Phase 1 (this section) was written from the run brief
(`BRIEF_ROUND2.md` §Run 1), the git history, the code (`nd2lean.py`, `lean_prompts.py`, `run_vllm.py`,
`run1_analysis.py`, `pod/r1/*.sh`), the data and the raw artefacts only — no executor write-up (`run1.md`,
`numbers.md` §Run 1, `STATUS.md`, `artifacts/r1/summary*.json`, `scale_summary.json`, figures) was read before it was
committed. All counts below come from my own code: `review_run1_recount.py` (own extraction of the model outputs, own
English → token parser, own tables, paired deltas and bootstrap, own step-3 first-size and rank correlation) and
`review_run1_lean_recheck.py` (own theorem-header renderer from the token prompt, own Lean batching with a sentinel
after every theorem, own error attribution, one-theorem-per-file re-check of every disagreement, and a scan of every
accepted Lean body for `sorry` / search tactics / constructs outside the have–exact fragment). Only `nd_verify` and
Lean 4.34.0 (`~/.elan/bin/lean`, core only) are shared with the executor; for the step-1 agreement table I also re-ran
the executor's translator, because the claim under test is that *that* translator agrees with `nd_verify`.
Machine-readable outputs: `artifacts/review_r1/agreement_recount.json`, `agreement_rerun.json`, `recount.json`,
`lean_recheck.json`, `lean_recheck_<model>_verdicts.json`, `lean_single_recheck.json` (`review_run1_single_check.py`).

## Recount

### Hard constraints and process

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `nd_verify` unmodified | tree hash of `nd_verify/` at HEAD = `origin/main` (9437bb7); both files byte-identical in the repo and the review copy |
| `artifacts/TEST_RUN_DONE` | byte-identical to `origin/main` (Sep 15 07:38, one test run) |
| training | none in this run: no `train.py` call, no checkpoint written; nothing touches supervised data or the cap |
| evaluation data in prompts | the 20 worked examples per draw come from `data/heldout.jsonl` (12, lengths 2–6) and the campaign's RL-found transfer proofs of 7–9 written lines (8); 98 distinct example theorems over the 5 draws, **0** in the renaming class of any of the 236 test theorems and 0 in `train.jsonl`'s 154,990 classes (my key). The same 20 examples are used for the three forms of a draw (one distinct example list per draw) and for all 236 theorems |
| test set | 36 = validation-36 (12 `<=6`, 24 `>6`) + 200 from `data/transfer.jsonl`, 21 per generator length 7–15 and 11 at 16, 236 distinct classes; the same 236 in every (draw, form) |
| the brief's step order ("commit the translator and the agreement table before step 2") | translator committed 22:49:28 (6c4592d); agreement numbers for negatives / val-36 logged 22:47; the pod for step 2 was created 23:22 and its first generation started 23:35:26 (`step2.log`). The translator's premise-naming bug fix (30d4110, 23:19:28) and the found-pool agreement files (23:54–01:02) post-date the start of step 2 |
| pre-registration | I found **no pre-registered numeric expectations for run 1** in `log.md` at any commit before the first pod job (23:22): the 22:47 entry describes the step-1 design and its first results; the run-3, run-4 and run-2 plans have `R<N>-E<k>` expectations, run 1 has none (checked at 6c4592d, c8e298c, a925656; `git log -S'R1-E1'` finds nothing on `dan_novelty`). The policy's "expected results written down before a run" is not met for steps 2–3 |
| brief update | `BRIEF_ROUND2.md` (b997558, 22:52:31) moved runs 1 and 4 to parallel executors on `dan_run1_lean` / `dan_run4_grpo` and told this branch not to run them. `dan_novelty` nevertheless ran the whole of run 1 (prompt set 23:24, pod 23:22, generations 23:35–01:29) and run 4 (log 23:15). Both parallel branches exist on the remote with their own run-1 / run-4 commits, so two independent run-1 results exist; this review covers `dan_novelty`'s only |

### Step 1 — translator agreement (`artifacts/r1/lean_*.jsonl`, my recount; nd labels re-verified with `nd_verify` on all 257,482 records, 0 label errors)

| file | n | both accept | nd only | Lean only | both reject | start index > 1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| val36_ref | 36 | 36 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| examples (21 handcrafted) | 21 | 21 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| heldout | 5,000 | 5,000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| rl_targets | 3,000 | 3,000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| transfer | 1,638 | 1,638 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| train10k | 10,000 | 10,000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| found_transfer16 (campaign) | 75,085 | 75,085 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 74,507 |
| found_targets16 (campaign) | 137,828 | 137,828 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 136,819 |
| r2_depth4_found | 15,327 | 15,327 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15,234 |
| r5_c8_found | 3,264 | 3,264 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3,209 |
| r5_reductio_found | 2,271 | 2,271 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2,241 |
| **positives** | **253,470** | **253,470** | 0 | 0 | 0 | |
| negatives (mutations) | 4,012 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4,012 | 435 |

Re-running the current translator + Lean on all 4,012 negatives, val-36, the 21 examples and 1,000-record samples of
heldout / transfer / rl_targets / train10k gives the same verdict as the file for every record (`agreement_rerun.json`),
so the six agreement files produced before the 23:19 fix are what the current code produces (their proofs all start at
N1, where the fix is a no-op). Every atom in the 257k records is one of P Q R S, so the fixed binder `(P Q R S : Prop)`
is complete.

**Who rejects the negatives.** 2,906 of the 4,012 are rejected by the translator's own structural pre-checks
(`forward cite` 511, `final line` 368, `depth jump` 361, `PR position` 349, `missing PR` 342, `arity` 210,
`bad box cite` 183, `AS depth` 81) before any Lean source exists; Lean itself rejects 1,106 (type mismatches). By
mutation kind: `atom` 874 / 874 by Lean, `rule` 229 by Lean + 645 structural, `cite` 508 / 508 structural, `depth`
874 / 874 structural, `drop` 874 / 874 structural. So "Lean rejects every corrupted proof" means "a Python
re-implementation of the verifier's structural rules plus Lean's type checker rejects every corrupted proof". That is
the right design for a checker, but the agreement table does not test Lean's judgement on box structure, citations or
dropped lines at all — those never reach Lean.

**A known divergence the mutation set cannot see.** Lean's `¬A` is definitionally `A → False`, and the translator
maps `( ~ A )` to `¬A` and `( A > F )` to `A → False`. Two reviewer-made proofs that `nd_verify` rejects
(`rule check failed`) and Lean accepts:
`THM ( ~ P ) SEQ ( P > F ) PRF N1 ( ~ P ) : PR ; N2 ( P > F ) : R N1 ; QED` and
`THM ( ( P > F ) > Q ) , ( ~ P ) SEQ Q PRF … N3 Q : IMPE N1 N2 ; QED`. The "⇔" therefore holds up to this
identification; none of the 236 step-2 or 106 step-3 theorems contains a `( A > F )` subformula, so it cannot have
affected the model-output scoring, and the generator's mutations (cited line ±k, rule swap, atom swap, box bar ±,
line drop) never produce it, which is why the table shows 0 Lean-only cases.

### Step 2 — in-context Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct, three surface forms (my re-judging of all 31,860 outputs)

Setup as found in the files: 3,540 prompts = 236 theorems × 5 example draws × 3 forms; 9 outputs each (greedy +
8 samples at T = 0.7, top-p 0.95, `max_tokens` 1,200, vLLM 0.29, one A100). The Lean prompt is the same 20 examples
translated by `nd2lean.translate`, the English prompt the same 20 with rule names spelled out; user-message length
6.9k / 7.5k / 10.5k characters (tokens / Lean / English). The Lean theorem header in every prompt equals my own
rendering of the token prompt (0 mismatches over 1,180 + 106 prompts).

Token and English outputs: my extraction + my English → token parser + `nd_verify` agree with the executor's `ok`
flag on all 21,240 rows (0 disagreements). Lean outputs: my own batching + attribution reproduces
the executor's verdict on all 10,620 bodies (13 chunk-level differences, all resolved in the executor's favour by a
one-theorem-per-file re-check; 0 remaining), 5,943 accepted; in addition, every one of the 5,943 accepted bodies was re-checked **alone in its own Lean file** (my header, no neighbours): 5,943 / 5,943 compile (`lean_single_recheck.json`). No accepted body contains `sorry`, `admit`,
`exact?`, `simp`, `decide`, `tauto` or any other search / automation tactic (3 outputs tried `tauto` / `sorry` / a
comment; all rejected). Note that the executor's checker would have passed a `sorry` or an `exact?` (both compile
with a warning only, `lean` exits 0 — I verified this on a test file), so this scan, not the checker, is what
establishes it.

| form | greedy pass@1 (95 % Wilson) | pass@8 (8 samples only) | pass@9 (greedy ∪ samples; the executor's "pass@8" definition in `run1_analysis.py`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| tokens | 0.258 [0.234, 0.283] | 0.320 | 0.326 [0.300, 0.354] |
| Lean | 0.563 [0.534, 0.591] | 0.672 | 0.675 [0.647, 0.701] |
| English | 0.292 [0.267, 0.319] | 0.378 | 0.386 [0.358, 0.414] |

n = 1,180 (theorem, draw) cells per form. Per draw (greedy): tokens 0.284 / 0.292 / 0.216 / 0.254 / 0.242, Lean
0.564 / 0.564 / 0.576 / 0.521 / 0.589, English 0.331 / 0.318 / 0.246 / 0.288 / 0.280 — the ordering
Lean ≫ English ≳ tokens holds in every draw.

Paired deltas per (theorem, draw), averaged over draws, bootstrapped over the 236 theorems (4,000 resamples):

| pair | greedy | pass@8 | pass@9 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lean − tokens | +0.305 [+0.257, +0.353] | +0.352 [+0.301, +0.403] | +0.348 [+0.298, +0.400] |
| English − tokens | +0.035 [−0.003, +0.072] | +0.058 [+0.015, +0.098] | +0.059 [+0.018, +0.101] |
| Lean − English | +0.270 [+0.216, +0.324] | +0.294 [+0.239, +0.348] | +0.289 [+0.233, +0.344] |

By bin (greedy, Lean / tokens / English): val36_<=6 0.867 / 0.433 / 0.500; val36_>6 0.458 / 0.158 / 0.100;
transfer_7 0.648 / 0.305 / 0.276; _8 0.600 / 0.267 / 0.400; _9 0.552 / 0.238 / 0.219; _10 0.600 / 0.257 / 0.381;
_11 0.505 / 0.162 / 0.238; _12 0.552 / 0.209 / 0.248; _13 0.581 / 0.314 / 0.391; _14 0.562 / 0.314 / 0.314;
_15 0.505 / 0.276 / 0.276; _16 0.382 / 0.236 / 0.273. The Lean − tokens greedy delta is ≥ +0.23 in every bin except
transfer_16 (+0.145, n = 55). Token accuracy does not fall with generator length beyond 7 (0.31 at 7, 0.31 at 13–14):
"length" here is the generator's line count of one proof, not the shortest proof, so the bins are not a difficulty
ladder. Unfinished outputs (no `QED` / final `exact` / final rule line): tokens 16 greedy + 96 samples, Lean 15 + 91,
English 6 + 52 of 1,180 / 9,440 each — truncation at 1,200 tokens is not what separates the forms.

**What the Lean checker accepts that the ND forms cannot.** The Lean form is scored by Lean's type checker, which
accepts any well-typed term, whereas the token / English forms must reproduce the calculus's line format exactly. Of
the 5,943 accepted Lean bodies, 4,108 are line-for-line in the prompt's have–exact fragment (every line
`have nK : F := term` or `exact nK`, terms built from the calculus's constructors); 1,822 use the same constructors in
term style (`fun h => …` without `by`, `Or.elim n1 (fun a => Or.inr a) (fun b => Or.inl b)`, `exact n3.elim`,
`⟨n1, n2⟩` inline); 10 use `match` on a disjunction (= `ORE`) and 8 `Classical.em` (excluded middle, which the
calculus derives via `DN`). None uses automation. So the Lean advantage is not Lean doing the proving; it is the
model writing correct natural-deduction terms far more often in Lean syntax than in the two ND line formats — and
being allowed any correct term rather than one canonical line format. The ND-side failures are dominated by
format-strict rejections that a Lean elaborator would tolerate (my re-judge reproduces the executor's reasons;
the split of ND rejections into "wrong proof" vs "right idea, wrong citation/format" is not measured).

### Step 3 — smallest Qwen3 size that proves the RL-found theorems in Lean (k = 16 + greedy, T = 0.7, thinking off)

The scale set (`data/r1/scale_prompts.jsonl`): 106 theorems in the Lean form with the step-2 draw-0 examples and
system prompt — `depth3_f0` 40 (from `targets_depth3`, RL proofs of 7–9 lines, all box depth ≥ 3 by my predicate,
first found at rounds 3–7), `reductio_f0` 40 (from run 5's `targets_reductio_req`, all reductio, 7 lines, rounds
1–5), `transfer9` **26** (campaign transfer theorems whose RL proof is 9 lines; rounds 4–16). The brief asked for
≥ 30 per class; the third class has 26. 106 distinct classes, 0 overlap with the example classes, 0 overlap with the
step-2 test set. Outputs: 6 sizes × 106 × 17 = 10,812 Lean bodies. My re-check reproduces every verdict (0.6B 1, 1.7B 0, 4B 166,
8B 804, 14B 1,194, 32B 1,322 accepted of 1,802 each; chunk-level differences 0 / 0 / 0 / 37 / 0 / 24, all resolved
in the executor's favour by single-file checks); every accepted body (3,487) also compiles alone in its own file. All 3,487 accepted bodies also verify alone in their own file. Automation attempts (`sorry`, `simp`, `assumption`,
`by_contra`, `trivial`, `contradiction`, …): 0 / 40 / 52 / 14 / 3 / 4 by size, **all rejected**; no accepted body
contains any.

| class | n | 0.6B | 1.7B | 4B | 8B | 14B | 32B | none | theorems with ≥ 1 accepted output at 4B / 8B / 14B / 32B |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| depth3_f0 | 40 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 14 | 12 | 2 | 0 | 12 / 26 / 37 / 40 |
| reductio_f0 | 40 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 19 | 10 | 6 | 1 | 4 / 21 / 26 / 34 |
| transfer9 | 26 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 10 | 6 | 0 | 1 | 9 / 18 / 25 / 25 |

(first-success size per theorem, my verdicts = the executor's; 0.6B: 1 accepted output of 1,802, 1.7B: 0.)

**Ordering against Phase-1 base log-probabilities.** The `phase1` field exists only for the 26 `transfer9` theorems
(the depth-3 and reductio classes have `phase1: null`), so the brief's comparison is possible for 26 theorems only.
Spearman between `base_logp_T1_max` and the first-success size rank: **−0.24** (n = 26, ties; higher base
log-probability ↔ smaller first size, weakly). The 8 theorems with the lowest base log-prob (−74 … −54) first succeed
at 8B / 14B / none; the 8 highest (−30 … −8) at 0.6B / 4B / 4B / 4B / 8B / 14B / 14B / 4B.

### Reproducibility

`python3 review_run1_lean_recheck.py` (≈ 25 min on the VPS: 21,432 Lean bodies in 536 chunk files plus individual
re-checks of disagreements), `python3 review_run1_lean_single.py` (≈ 45 min: the 9,430 accepted bodies one per file),
`python3 review_run1_agreement.py A` / `B` (step 1) and `python3 review_run1_recount.py` in the repository root regenerate every number above from
`data/r1/`, `artifacts/r1/gens_*.jsonl`, `artifacts/r1/scored_*.jsonl` and `artifacts/r1/lean_*.jsonl`; outputs in
`artifacts/review_r1/`. Not re-derived: pod spend, the bucket contents beyond `upload.log` (`round2/run1/{artifacts/r1,data/r1}`, 42 files),
the vLLM sampling itself.

## Compare (phase 2: `run1.md`, `numbers.md` §Round 2 — Run 1, `log.md` 23:20–01:32, `STATUS.md` §Run 1, `artifacts/r1/summary.json`, `scale_summary.json`, `figures/run1_forms.png`, `run1_scale.png`)

Two corrections to my phase-1 process notes. (1) The proposal document
(`~/nd-rl` `dan_proposals`, `docs/proposals/2026-09-17-proposals-round-2.md`, committed 2026-09-17 18:44 UTC, before
any run-1 job) does carry the run's predictions ("Lean helps ≥ 10 pp, most on nested-box-heavy proofs"; "scale of
first success correlates with base log-probability but ranks depth-3 proofs easier"), and the executor's 01:32 log
entry scores them. So the predictions were pre-registered there; what is missing is a numeric expectation per step
in `log.md` as the other four runs have, and any prediction for step 3's absolute levels. (2) The brief update
(22:52) is not mentioned anywhere in `STATUS.md`, `log.md` or `QUESTIONS.md`; the run went ahead in parallel with
`dan_run1_lean` without a note. The results are not affected by either point.

| claim (executor) | my independent value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `numbers.md` step 1: twelve agreement rows (n, both accept, nd-only, Lean-only, both reject) | identical in every cell; nd labels re-verified on all 257,482 records; the six pre-fix files reproduce under the current translator | reproduces |
| `run1.md`: "0 disagreements with nd_verify on … 75,085 RL-found transfer proofs; 4,012 / 4,012 corrupted proofs rejected by both. The project has a second checker" | positives 253,470 / 253,470 (the write-up omits the 137,828 target proofs and the run-2 / run-5 pools, which are in `numbers.md`). Of the 4,012 negatives, 2,906 never reach Lean — they are rejected by the translator's Python mirror of the verifier's structural rules; Lean itself rejects 1,106 (`numbers.md` says this correctly, "by Lean or by the translator's structural mirror"; `run1.md` does not). And Lean identifies `( ~ A )` with `( A > F )`, which `nd_verify` does not (two reviewer-made proofs: ND rejects, Lean accepts) | numbers reproduce; **reword** "rejected by both" → "rejected by the translator's structural checks (2,906) or by Lean (1,106)", and "second checker" → "a second checker for the logical content, with the structural rules re-implemented rather than delegated, and one known identification (`¬A ≡ A → False`) that the mutation set cannot exercise" |
| step-2 table: Lean 0.563 / 0.675, tokens 0.258 / 0.326, English 0.292 / 0.386; val-36 `> 6` greedy 0.458 / 0.158 / 0.100; all 36 bin rows in `numbers.md` with Wilson intervals | identical (own extraction, own English parser, own Lean batching; every accepted Lean body also verified alone in its own file) | reproduces |
| "pass@8" column | is greedy ∪ 8 samples (9 attempts; `run1_analysis.py` `s or g`); samples-only pass@8 is 0.672 / 0.320 / 0.378 — a difference of ≤ 0.008 | reproduces; label it pass@9 or say "greedy or any of 8 samples" |
| "Paired Lean − tokens over 236 theorems: +0.31 [0.26, 0.35] greedy, +0.35 [0.30, 0.40] pass@8" | +0.305 [+0.257, +0.353] and +0.348 [+0.298, +0.400] (own bootstrap, 4,000 resamples) | reproduces |
| "The gain is largest on the shortest theorems (+0.34 at 7 lines, +0.15 at 16), the opposite of the proposal's prediction" | by-bin greedy delta +0.343 (7) … +0.145 (16), largest at val36 `<=6` (+0.433); reproduces. But "length" is the generator's line count of one proof, not the shortest proof or the box depth, and token accuracy is flat from 7 to 15 lines (0.31, 0.27, 0.24, 0.26, 0.16, 0.21, 0.31, 0.31, 0.28) — the bins are not a difficulty or nesting ladder, so the proposal's "nested-box-heavy" prediction has not been tested against a nesting measure | reproduces; the inference against the proposal needs a box-depth (or shortest-length) stratification, which the data allow (`nd2lean`'s translation gives the depth of every reference proof) |
| "The English control sits with the tokens: the cost is the calculus-as-string, not the rule names" | English − tokens +0.035 [−0.003, +0.072] greedy, +0.059 [+0.018, +0.101] pass@9; Lean − English +0.270 / +0.289 | reproduces. One caveat belongs next to it: the Lean form is scored by Lean's elaborator, which accepts any well-typed term (1,822 of the 5,943 accepted bodies are term-style rather than the prompt's line format; 18 use `match` / `Classical.em`), while the two ND forms must hit one exact line format — the ND rejections are dominated by citation and arity errors (`rule check failed: NEGE` 117 / 146, `bad box cite` 100 / 100, `bad line cite` 99 / 88, `wrong ref count for ORE` 79 / 98 of 876 / 835 greedy rejections). Part of the +0.31 is therefore "Lean tolerates more ways of being right", not only "the model is better at Lean". No accepted Lean body uses automation (0 of 5,943), so none of it is Lean doing the proving |
| step 3: "Nothing below 4B proves them; median smallest size 8B for all three classes; fraction proved at 4B / 8B / 14B / 32B 0.30 / 0.65 / 0.93 / 1.00, 0.10 / 0.53 / 0.65 / 0.85, 0.35 / 0.69 / 0.96 / 0.96" | first-size counts identical (`scale_summary.json` = my table); cumulative any-pass 12 / 26 / 37 / 40, 4 / 21 / 26 / 34, 9 / 18 / 25 / 25 → the stated fractions; median 8B in each class. 0.6B proves 1 of the 26 transfer theorems (`numbers.md` has 0.04; "nothing below 4B" is off by that one). "The rule sequence keeps 15 % beyond 14B": 6 first at 32B + 1 never = 7 / 40 = 17.5 % not proved by 14B (15 % is the 32B share alone) | reproduces; two small rewords |
| "Spearman −0.24 on the 26 transfer theorems" | −0.237 (own rank correlation with ties) on the only 26 theorems that carry a Phase-1 log-probability; the depth-3 and reductio classes have none, so the brief's ordering comparison covers one class of three | reproduces; say so |

## Verdict

**What stands.** Every number in `run1.md`, `numbers.md` §Run 1, `summary.json` and `scale_summary.json` reproduces
from the raw generations with independent code: all 21,240 token / English outputs re-judged with my own extraction
and parser, all 21,432 Lean outputs re-checked with my own batching, and all 9,430 accepted Lean bodies re-verified
one per file — 0 differences anywhere, 0 `sorry` / search tactics among the accepted, 0 theorem-header mismatches.
The translator agrees with `nd_verify` on 253,470 valid proofs of every kind the project has produced (including the
shifted-index RL proofs after the 23:19 fix) and rejects all 4,012 mutations. The prompts are fair in the sense the
brief asked for: same theorems, same 20 examples per draw in all three forms, examples class-disjoint from every
test theorem and from the training set. The three clean results are: (i) Qwen3-Coder-30B in context proves 56 % of
the theorems greedily when they are posed in Lean against 26 % in the take-home token format and 29 % in plain
English (paired +0.31 [+0.26, +0.35], the same ordering in all five example draws); (ii) the English control shows
the token format's opacity is not the cause; (iii) on the RL-found classes the smallest Qwen3 that writes a Lean
proof is 4B–14B for 90 % of the theorems, median 8B in every class, with nothing at 1.7B and one theorem at 0.6B.

**What must be reworded.** (1) "4,012 / 4,012 rejected by both" and "the project has a second checker": 2,906 of
the negatives are rejected by the translator's own re-implementation of the structural rules and never reach Lean;
Lean's judgement is exercised only on the 1,106 atom / rule mutations that survive translation, and Lean identifies
`¬A` with `A → False` where `nd_verify` does not. The honest statement is "Lean checks the logical content of every
valid proof we have and rejects every content mutation; the structural rules are mirrored in Python, not delegated".
(2) The step-2 comparison is between a type checker that accepts any correct term and two formats that demand one
exact line syntax; ND rejections are mostly citation / arity slips. The +0.31 is real as a statement about *what a
checker accepts from the model*, but "Lean makes the model better at natural deduction" needs a format-tolerant
ND judge (or a Lean judge restricted to the have–exact fragment) to separate the two. (3) The length result
("largest gain on the shortest theorems, opposite to the prediction") uses generator length, which is not
difficulty (token accuracy is flat over 7–15) and not nesting; the proposal's prediction is about box depth and
is untested as such. (4) The base-log-probability comparison exists for 26 transfer theorems only, and the depth-3
"< 10⁻⁵" is a pool rate, not a per-theorem log-probability. Minor: pass@8 is greedy ∪ 8; 0.6B proves one theorem;
"15 % beyond 14B" is 17.5 %; 26 < 30 in the third class; 464 words.

**Flags.** No numeric pre-registration in `log.md` for steps 2–3 (the proposal's qualitative predictions were
committed before the run and are scored at 01:32); the 22:52 brief update reassigning run 1 was neither followed nor
acknowledged, so a second, independent run-1 result on `dan_run1_lean` exists and the two should be compared before
either is quoted. No training happened in this run; nothing here touches the take-home's submission constraints.

**Next measurement.** (1) Fairness of the judge: re-score the token and English outputs with a *repair-tolerant*
judge (accept a proof if a single citation index or arity fix makes it verify — the run-3 review's one-token repair
search already exists) and, symmetrically, restrict the Lean judge to bodies that translate back into the calculus;
report the paired delta under both. If the delta survives, Lean's advantage is in the model, not the checker.
(2) Stratify step 2 by the reference proof's box depth and by shortest proof length (`minlen.py`), which is what the
proposal predicted on; the current length bins cannot test it. (3) Give the depth-3 and reductio scale theorems the
Phase-1 per-theorem base log-probability (one pass of the take-home base model on the RL proof, as was done for the
transfer pool) so the ordering comparison covers all three classes and the "ranks depth-3 easier" claim becomes a
number; and top the third class up to ≥ 30 with 9-line proofs from the round-9–16 continuation. (4) Reconcile with
`dan_run1_lean`: same translator claims, same prompts? If the two agreement tables and the two paired deltas agree,
the result is replicated for free.
